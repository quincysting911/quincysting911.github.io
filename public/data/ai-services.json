      "title": "AWS Glue Data Quality now supports pre-processing queries",
      "description": "Today, AWS announces the general availability of preprocessing queries for AWS Glue Data Quality, enabling you to transform your data before running data quality checks through AWS Glue Data Catalog APIs. This feature allows you to create derived columns, filter data based on specific conditions, perform calculations, and validate relationships between\n columns directly within your data quality evaluation process.\n \nPreprocessing queries provide enhanced flexibility for complex data quality scenarios that require data transformation before validation. You can create derived metrics like calculating total fees from tax and shipping columns, limiting number of columns that are considered for data quality recommendations or filter datasets to focus quality checks on specific data subsets. This capability eliminates the need for separate data pre-processing steps, streamlining your data quality workflows.\n \nAWS Glue Data Quality preprocessing queries are available through AWS Glue Data Catalog APIs - start-data-quality-rule-recommendation-run and start-data-quality-ruleset-evaluation-run, in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Glue Data Quality is available. To learn more about preprocessing queries, see the Glue Data Quality documentation.",

      "title": "AWS Elemental MediaTailor now supports HLS Interstitials for live streams",
      "description": "AWS Elemental MediaTailor now supports HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) Interstitials for live streams, enabling broadcasters and streaming service providers to deliver seamless, personalized ad experiences across a wide range of modern video players. This capability allows customers to insert interstitial advertisements and promotions directly into live streams using the HLS Interstitials specification (RFC 8216), which is natively supported by popular players including HLS.js, Shaka Player, Bitmovin Player, and Apple devices running iOS 16.4, iPadOS 16.4, tvOS 16.4, and later.\n  With HLS Interstitials, MediaTailor automatically generates the necessary metadata tags (Interstitial class EXT-X-DATERANGE with X-ASSET-LIST attributes) that signal to client players when and how to play interstitial content. This approach eliminates the need for custom player-side stitching logic, reducing development complexity and ensuring consistent playback behavior. The feature integrates with MediaTailor's existing server-side ad insertion (SSAI) capabilities, delivering frame-accurate transitions with no buffering between content and interstitials. Server-side beaconing continues to work with HLS Interstitials, ensuring ad tracking and measurement workflows remain intact.\n  HLS Interstitials for live streams is particularly valuable for sports broadcasts, live news, and event streaming where precise ad timing and minimal latency are critical. The feature supports pre-roll and mid-roll insertion, giving customers flexibility in how they monetize their live content. This launch complements MediaTailor's existing HLS Interstitials support for VOD, rounding out support across Linear, Live, FAST, and VOD workflows. MediaTailor makes it easy to test and deploy—customers can rapidly enable or disable HLS Interstitials with a simple query parameter on the multi-variant manifest request, providing per playback session control without changing the underlying MediaTailor configuration.\n  AWS Elemental MediaTailor HLS Interstitials for live streams is available today in all AWS Regions where MediaTailor operates. You pay only for the features you use, with no upfront commitments. To learn more and get started, visit the AWS Elemental MediaTailor documentation and the HLS Interstitials implementation guide.",

      "title": "Announcing AWS Compute Optimizer automation rules",
      "description": "Today, we are introducing automation rules, a new feature in AWS Compute Optimizer that enables you to optimize Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes at scale. With automation rules, you can streamline the process of cleaning up unattached EBS volumes and upgrading volumes to the latest-generation volume types, saving cost and improving performance across your cloud infrastructure.\n  Automation rules let you automatically apply optimization recommendations on a recurring schedule when they match your criteria. You can set criteria like AWS Region to target specific geographies and Resource Tags to distinguish between production and development workloads. Configure rules to run daily, weekly, or monthly, and AWS Compute Optimizer will continuously evaluate new recommendations against your criteria. A new dashboard allows you to summarize automation events over time, examine detailed step history, and estimate savings achieved. If you need to reverse an action, you can do so directly from the same dashboard.\n  AWS Compute Optimizer automation rules are available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), and South America (São Paulo).\n  To get started, navigate to the new Automation section in the AWS Compute Optimizer console, visit the AWS Compute Optimizer user guide documentation, or read the announcement blog to learn more.",

You can now maximize agent utilization across multiple dimensions such as departments, languages, and customer tiers by intelligently matching agents with multiple skills to forecasted demand. You can now also preserve multi-skilled agents for high-value interactions when needed most. For example, bilingual agents can now be strategically scheduled to cover peak periods for high-value French language queues that frequently experience staffing shortages, while handling general inquiries during off-peak times.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Connect agent scheduling is available.
