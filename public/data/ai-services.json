      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Serverless has added support for Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant endpoints for Data Plane APIs in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), Canada (Central), AWS GovCloud (US-East), and AWS GovCloud (US-West). The service now meets the security requirements for cryptographic modules as outlined in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3.\n  Please refer to the AWS Regional Services List for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability.

      "title": "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling now supports predictive scaling in six more regions",
      "description": "Customers can now enable predictive scaling for their Auto Scaling groups (ASGs) in six more regions: Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Israel (Tel Aviv), Canada West (Calgary), Europe (Spain), and Europe (Zurich). Predictive Scaling can proactively scale out your ASGs to be ready for upcoming demand. This allows you to avoid the need to over-provision capacity, resulting in lower EC2 cost, while ensuring your application’s responsiveness. To see the list of all supported AWS public regions and AWS GovCloud (US) regions, click here.\n  Predictive Scaling is appropriate for applications that experience recurring patterns of steep demand changes, such as early morning spikes when business resumes. It learns from the past patterns and launches instances in advance of predicted demand, giving instances time to warm up. Predictive scaling enhances existing Auto Scaling policies, such as Target Tracking or Simple Scaling, so that your applications scale based on both real-time metrics and historic patterns. You can preview how Predictive Scaling works with your ASG by using the “Forecast Only” mode.\n  Predictive Scaling is available as a scaling policy type through AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), EC2 Auto Scaling Management Console, AWS CloudFormation and AWS SDKs. To learn more, visit the Predictive Scaling page in the EC2 Auto Scaling documentation.",

      "description": "In this post, we explore how Metagenomi built a scalable database and search solution for over 1 billion protein vectors using LanceDB and Amazon S3. The solution enables rapid enzyme discovery by transforming proteins into vector embeddings and implementing a serverless architecture that combines AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon S3 for efficient nearest neighbor searches.",
