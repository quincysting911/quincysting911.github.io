      "description": "Amazon Connect now makes it easier to manage contact center operating hours for recurring events like holidays, maintenance windows, and promotional periods, with a visual calendar that provides at-a-glance visibility by day, month, or year. You can set up recurring overrides that automatically take effect weekly, monthly, or every other Friday, and use them to provide customers with personalized experiences, all without having to manually revisit configurations. For example, every January 1st you can automatically greet customers with \"Happy New Year!\" and route them to a special holiday message before checking if agents are available, then on January 2nd your contact center automatically returns to normal operations.\n  These additional hours of operation override capabilities are available in all AWS regions where Amazon Connect is available and offer public API and AWS CloudFormation support. To learn more, see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. To learn more about Amazon Connect, please visit the Amazon Connect website.",
