      "description": "Amazon Connect Outbound Campaigns now supports visual journey builder, a new feature that lets you create multi-step, multi-channel customer engagements directly in the Amazon Connect console. You can design end-to-end engagement experiences that combine voice, SMS, email, and WhatsApp interactions to reach customers proactively and reduce inbound contact volume.\n  Outbound Campaigns help you automate personalized communication flows based on customer behavior or time-based triggers. For example, you can send an appointment reminder by SMS, follow up with a voice call if the customer does not respond, and send a confirmation email once the appointment is booked. You can also configure steps in the journey builder that offer customers the option to connect with a live agent through Amazon Connect when additional support is needed. You can use existing Amazon Connect Flow integrations, AI capabilities, and customer data from Amazon Connect Customer Profiles to tailor each interaction. This helps contact centers improve engagement rates, reduce manual effort, and deliver more consistent customer experiences.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Connect Outbound Campaigns is supported. To learn more, visit the Amazon Connect Outbound Campaigns documentation.",

      "description": "AWS Marketplace customers can now receive private offers for third-party products in minutes through express private offers. This capability enables customers to access personalized pricing and terms which previously required lengthy sales discussions, thereby accelerating software procurement and reducing customer time-to-value.\n  Previously, obtaining personalized pricing required customers to initiate contact with sales teams, engage in discussions to negotiate terms, and navigate multiple review cycles before receiving a customized offer. Now, customers can use express private offers to get an offer within minutes by responding to a few questions. Customers are invited to use the new AI-powered experience on participating products, where they specify their purchase requirements and contract duration. AWS generates a private offer by automatically evaluating these requirements against a seller’s pre-configured pricing rules. For more customized solutions that fall outside these parameters, customers can be connected to sales representatives for additional assistance. This streamlines access to personalized pricing while ensuring customers receive offers tailored to their needs.\n  This capability is available today in all AWS Regions where the AWS Marketplace website is supported.\n  To learn more about requesting express private offers, visit the AWS Marketplace Buyer Guide. For sellers interested in enabling this feature on their listing page, visit the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.",

      "description": "Today, AWS announces that AWS Compute Optimizer now supports idle resource recommendations for NAT Gateways. With this new recommendation type, you will be able to identify NAT Gateways that are unused, resulting in cost savings.\n  With the new unused NAT Gateway recommendation, you will be able to identify NAT Gateways that show no traffic activity over a 32-day analysis period. Compute Optimizer analyzes CloudWatch metrics including active connection count, incoming packets from source, and incoming packets from destination to validate if NAT Gateways are truly unused. To avoid recommending critical backup resources, Compute Optimizer also examines if the NAT Gateway resource is associated in any AWS Route Tables. You can view the total savings potential of these unused NAT Gateways and access detailed utilization metrics to verify unused conditions before taking action.\n  This new feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Compute Optimizer is available except the AWS GovCloud (US) and the China Regions. To learn more about the new feature updates, please visit Compute Optimizer’s product page and user guide.",

      "description": "Today, AWS announces the general availability of preprocessing queries for AWS Glue Data Quality, enabling you to transform your data before running data quality checks through AWS Glue Data Catalog APIs. This feature allows you to create derived columns, filter data based on specific conditions, perform calculations, and validate relationships between\n columns directly within your data quality evaluation process.\n \nPreprocessing queries provide enhanced flexibility for complex data quality scenarios that require data transformation before validation. You can create derived metrics like calculating total fees from tax and shipping columns, limiting number of columns that are considered for data quality recommendations or filter datasets to focus quality checks on specific data subsets. This capability eliminates the need for separate data pre-processing steps, streamlining your data quality workflows.\n \nAWS Glue Data Quality preprocessing queries are available through AWS Glue Data Catalog APIs - start-data-quality-rule-recommendation-run and start-data-quality-ruleset-evaluation-run, in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Glue Data Quality is available. To learn more about preprocessing queries, see the Glue Data Quality documentation.",

      "title": "AWS Elemental MediaTailor now supports HLS Interstitials for live streams",
      "description": "AWS Elemental MediaTailor now supports HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) Interstitials for live streams, enabling broadcasters and streaming service providers to deliver seamless, personalized ad experiences across a wide range of modern video players. This capability allows customers to insert interstitial advertisements and promotions directly into live streams using the HLS Interstitials specification (RFC 8216), which is natively supported by popular players including HLS.js, Shaka Player, Bitmovin Player, and Apple devices running iOS 16.4, iPadOS 16.4, tvOS 16.4, and later.\n  With HLS Interstitials, MediaTailor automatically generates the necessary metadata tags (Interstitial class EXT-X-DATERANGE with X-ASSET-LIST attributes) that signal to client players when and how to play interstitial content. This approach eliminates the need for custom player-side stitching logic, reducing development complexity and ensuring consistent playback behavior. The feature integrates with MediaTailor's existing server-side ad insertion (SSAI) capabilities, delivering frame-accurate transitions with no buffering between content and interstitials. Server-side beaconing continues to work with HLS Interstitials, ensuring ad tracking and measurement workflows remain intact.\n  HLS Interstitials for live streams is particularly valuable for sports broadcasts, live news, and event streaming where precise ad timing and minimal latency are critical. The feature supports pre-roll and mid-roll insertion, giving customers flexibility in how they monetize their live content. This launch complements MediaTailor's existing HLS Interstitials support for VOD, rounding out support across Linear, Live, FAST, and VOD workflows. MediaTailor makes it easy to test and deploy—customers can rapidly enable or disable HLS Interstitials with a simple query parameter on the multi-variant manifest request, providing per playback session control without changing the underlying MediaTailor configuration.\n  AWS Elemental MediaTailor HLS Interstitials for live streams is available today in all AWS Regions where MediaTailor operates. You pay only for the features you use, with no upfront commitments. To learn more and get started, visit the AWS Elemental MediaTailor documentation and the HLS Interstitials implementation guide.",
