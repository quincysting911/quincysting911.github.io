      "title": "AWS Marketplace Seller Reporting now provides collections visibility",
      "description": "Today, AWS announces collection visibility in AWS Marketplace Seller Reporting, which adds up-to-date payment collection status to the Billed Revenue Dashboard and Billing Event Data Feed.\n  This enhancement enables sellers to distinguish between invoiced, collected, and disbursed amounts, eliminating the visibility gap between invoice creation and disbursement. With this feature, sellers can make informed business decisions and reduce unnecessary follow-ups with customers about payment status.\n  Collection visibility particularly benefits sellers using monthly disbursement who previously waited up to 30 days to understand payment collection status. All AWS Marketplace sellers can now improve payment forecasting accuracy and detect collection issues earlier. This enhanced visibility streamlines seller operations and improves customer relationships by providing clarity on payment status.\n  Collection visibility is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Seller Reporting is available. The feature launches on January 6th, 2026 for all AWS sellers.\n  To access collection visibility, log into the AWS Marketplace Management Portal and navigate to Insights → Finance Operations",

      "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) now offers enhanced observability for your snapshot exports to Amazon S3, providing detailed insights into export progress, failures, and performance for each task. These notifications enable you to monitor your exports with greater granularity and enables more predictability.\n  With snapshot export to S3, you can export data from your RDS database snapshots to Apache Parquet format in your Amazon S3 bucket. This launch introduces four new event types, including current export progress and table-level notifications for long-running tables, providing more granular visibility into your snapshot export performance and recommendations for troubleshooting export operation issues. Additionally, you can view export progress, such as the number of tables exported and pending, along with exported data sizes, enabling you to better plan your operations and workflows. You can subscribe to these events through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive notifications and view the export events through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDK.\n  This feature is available for RDS PostgreSQL, RDS MySQL, and RDS MariaDB engines in all Commercial Regions where RDS is generally available.\n  To learn more about the new event types, see Event categories in RDS.",
