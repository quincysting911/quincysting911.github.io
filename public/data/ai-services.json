      "title": "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling now supports predictive scaling in six more regions",
      "description": "Customers can now enable predictive scaling for their Auto Scaling groups (ASGs) in six more regions: Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Israel (Tel Aviv), Canada West (Calgary), Europe (Spain), and Europe (Zurich). Predictive Scaling can proactively scale out your ASGs to be ready for upcoming demand. This allows you to avoid the need to over-provision capacity, resulting in lower EC2 cost, while ensuring your application’s responsiveness. To see the list of all supported AWS public regions and AWS GovCloud (US) regions, click here.\n  Predictive Scaling is appropriate for applications that experience recurring patterns of steep demand changes, such as early morning spikes when business resumes. It learns from the past patterns and launches instances in advance of predicted demand, giving instances time to warm up. Predictive scaling enhances existing Auto Scaling policies, such as Target Tracking or Simple Scaling, so that your applications scale based on both real-time metrics and historic patterns. You can preview how Predictive Scaling works with your ASG by using the “Forecast Only” mode.\n  Predictive Scaling is available as a scaling policy type through AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), EC2 Auto Scaling Management Console, AWS CloudFormation and AWS SDKs. To learn more, visit the Predictive Scaling page in the EC2 Auto Scaling documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudWatch now offers interactive incident report generation, enabling customers to create comprehensive post-incident analysis reports in minutes. The new capability, available within CloudWatch investigations, automatically gathers and correlates your telemetry data, as well as your input and any actions taken during an investigation, and produces a streamlined incident report.\n  Using the new feature you can automatically capture critical operational telemetry, service configurations, and investigation findings to generate detailed reports. Reports include executive summaries, timeline of events, impact assessments, and actionable recommendations. These reports help you better identify patterns, implement preventive measures, and continuously improve your operational posture through structured post incident analysis.\n  The incident report generation feature is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Spain), and Europe (Stockholm).\n  You can create their first incident report by first creating a CloudWatch investigation and then clicking “Incident report”.

      "description": "Amazon Neptune Analytics is now available in the AWS Canada (Central) and Australia (Sydney) Regions. You can now create and manage Neptune Analytics graphs in the AWS Canada (Central) and Australia (Sydney) Regions and run advanced graph analytics and vector similarity search.\n  Neptune Analytics is a memory-optimized graph database engine for analytics. With Neptune Analytics, you can get insights and find trends by processing large amounts of graph data in seconds. To analyze graph data quickly and easily, Neptune Analytics stores large graph datasets in memory. It supports a library of optimized graph analytic algorithms, low-latency graph queries, and vector search capabilities within graph traversals. Neptune Analytics is an ideal choice for investigatory, exploratory, or data-science workloads that require fast iteration for data, analytical and algorithmic processing, or vector search on graph data. It complements Amazon Neptune Database, a popular managed graph database. To perform intensive analysis, you can load the data from a Neptune Database graph or snapshot into Neptune Analytics. You can also load graph data that's stored in Amazon S3.\n  To get started, you can create a new Neptune Analytics graphs using the AWS Management Console, or AWS CLI. For more information on pricing and region availability, refer to the Neptune pricing page and AWS Region Table.",
