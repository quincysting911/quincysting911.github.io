      "description": "Amazon Connect now makes it easier to manage contact center operating hours for recurring events like holidays, maintenance windows, and promotional periods, with a visual calendar that provides at-a-glance visibility by day, month, or year. You can set up recurring overrides that automatically take effect weekly, monthly, or every other Friday, and use them to provide customers with personalized experiences, all without having to manually revisit configurations. For example, every January 1st you can automatically greet customers with \"Happy New Year!\" and route them to a special holiday message before checking if agents are available, then on January 2nd your contact center automatically returns to normal operations.\n  These additional hours of operation override capabilities are available in all AWS regions where Amazon Connect is available and offer public API and AWS CloudFormation support. To learn more, see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. To learn more about Amazon Connect, please visit the Amazon Connect website.",

      "description": "Today, AWS announces collection visibility in AWS Marketplace Seller Reporting, which adds up-to-date payment collection status to the Billed Revenue Dashboard and Billing Event Data Feed.\n  This enhancement enables sellers to distinguish between invoiced, collected, and disbursed amounts, eliminating the visibility gap between invoice creation and disbursement. With this feature, sellers can make informed business decisions and reduce unnecessary follow-ups with customers about payment status.\n  Collection visibility particularly benefits sellers using monthly disbursement who previously waited up to 30 days to understand payment collection status. All AWS Marketplace sellers can now improve payment forecasting accuracy and detect collection issues earlier. This enhanced visibility streamlines seller operations and improves customer relationships by providing clarity on payment status.\n  Collection visibility is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Seller Reporting is available. The feature launches on January 6th, 2026 for all AWS sellers.\n  To access collection visibility, log into the AWS Marketplace Management Portal and navigate to Insights → Finance Operations",
