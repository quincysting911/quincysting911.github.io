      "description": "Today, AWS announces deal sizing capability in AWS Partner Central. This new feature, available within the APN Customer Engagements (ACE) Opportunities, uses AI to provide deal size estimates and AWS service recommendations. Deal Sizing capability allows Partners to save time on deal management by simplifying the process of estimating AWS monthly recurring revenue (MMR) when creating or updating opportunities.\n  Partners can optionally import AWS Pricing Calculator URLs to automatically populate AWS service selections and corresponding spend estimates into their opportunities, reducing the need for manual re-entry. When a Pricing Calculator URL is provided, deal sizing delivers enhanced insights including pricing strategy optimization recommendations, potential cost savings analysis, Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) eligibility indicators, and modernization pathway analysis. These enhanced insights help Partners refine their technical approach and strengthen funding applications, accelerating the funding approval process.\n  Deal sizing is now available in AWS Partner Central worldwide. The feature is accessible through both AWS Partner Central and the AWS Partner Central API for Selling, which is available in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.\n  To get started, log in to AWS Partner Central in the console to create or update opportunities and view deal sizing insights. For API integration with your CRM system, see the AWS Partner Central API Documentation. To learn more about deal sizing, visit the Partner Central Sales Guide.",
