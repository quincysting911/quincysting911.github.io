      "title": "Billing View now supports cost management data from multiple organizations",
      "description": "Today, AWS announces the general availability of new capabilities within AWS Billing and Cost Management that enable customers to manage their AWS spend across multiple organizations through a single AWS account. Customers can now share custom billing views containing cost management data with other AWS accounts outside their organization. Additionally, customers can combine multiple custom billing views to create new consolidated views. These features enable FinOps teams to create custom billing views containing cost management data for multiple organizations. These views can then be used to access cost management data across multiple organizations through Cost Explorer or set up budgets to monitor AWS costs.\n \nWith the new custom billing view capabilities, you can create consolidated views of cost management data spanning multiple organizations that can be accessed using AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets, allowing you to monitor, analyze, and forecast spending patterns across multiple organizations. This helps customers operating multiple subsidiaries or business units as separate organizations on AWS manage their AWS spend through a single AWS account.\n \nSupport for custom billing views containing cost management data for multiple organizations is available in all AWS Regions, excluding AWS GovCloud Regions and the AWS China Regions. To get started with custom billing views, visit Billing View within the Cost Management Preferences page in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and create a new custom billing view. To get started visit the Billing View user guide.",

      "description": "Amazon DataZone is now available in AWS Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Malaysia) and Europe (Zurich) Regions.\n  Amazon DataZone is a fully managed data management service to catalog, discover, analyze, share, and govern data between data producers and consumers in your organization. With Amazon DataZone, data producers populate the business data catalog with structured data assets from AWS Glue Data Catalog and Amazon Redshift tables. Data consumers search and subscribe to data assets in the data catalog and share with other collaborators working on the same business use case. Consumers can analyze their subscribed data assets with tools—such as Amazon Redshift or Amazon Athena query editors—that are directly accessed from the Amazon DataZone portal. The integrated publishing and subscription workflow provides access to auditing capabilities across projects.\n  For more information on AWS Regions where Amazon DataZone is available in preview, see supported regions.\n \nAdditionally, Amazon DataZone powers governance in the next generation of Amazon SageMaker, which simplifies the discovery, governance, and collaboration of data and AI across your lakehouse, AI models, and GenAI applications. With Amazon SageMaker Catalog (built on Amazon DataZone), users can securely discover and access approved data and models using semantic search with generative AI–created metadata, or they could just ask Amazon Q Developer using natural language to find their data. For more information on AWS Regions where the next generation of SageMaker is available, see supported regions. To learn more about the next generation of SageMaker, visit the product webpage.",

      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion now supports cross-account ingestion for push-based sources such as HTTP and OpenTelemetry (OTel). With this launch, customers can easily share OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines across AWS accounts without relying on additional configurations like VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway.\n \nThis capability makes it simpler for organizations with multiple accounts to centralize observability and analytics workflows. For example, a central logging team can create ingestion pipelines and grant access to development teams across different accounts, enabling them to ingest logs, metrics, and traces directly into OpenSearch domains or OpenSearch Serverless collections. This reduces operational overhead and lowers the cost of sharing ingestion pipelines across accounts.\n \nCross-account ingestion for Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion is available today in all AWS regions where OpenSearch Ingestion is offered. Customers can get started by creating resource policies in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI, and then enabling pipeline endpoints from their VPCs to ingest data seamlessly.\n \nTo learn more about this feature, see the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide and the launch blog.",

      "description": "We are excited to announce the launch of disk-optimized vector support for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, offering customers a cost-effective solution for vector search operations without compromising on accuracy and recall rates. This new feature enables organizations to implement high-quality vector search capabilities while significantly reducing operational costs.\n  With the introduction of Disk Optimized Vectors, customers can now choose between memory-optimized and disk-optimized vector storage options. The disk-optimized option delivers the same high accuracy and recall rates as memory-optimized vectors at lower cost. While this option may introduce slightly higher latency, it's ideal for use cases where sub-millisecond response times aren't critical such as semantic search applications, recommendation systems, and other AI-powered search scenarios.\n  Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, our fully managed deployment option, eliminates the complexities of infrastructure management for search and analytics workloads. The service automatically scales compute capacity, measured in OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs), based on your workload demands.\n \nPlease refer to the AWS Regional Services List for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability. To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see the documentation.",

OpenSearch 3.1 introduces several improvements in areas like search relevance and performance, and introduces features that simplify development of vector-driven applications for generative AI workloads.\n \nThis launch incorporates Lucene 10 that enables optimized vector field indexing resulting in faster indexing times and reduced index sizes, sparse indexing for CPU and storage efficiency improvements, and vector quantization to reduce memory usage. Other key areas of improvement include improved range query performance, which benefits log analytics and time-series workloads, and reduced latency for high-cardinality aggregations.\n \nThis launch also introduces a new Search Relevance Workbench, which provides integrated tools for teams to evaluate and optimize search quality through experimentation. Additionally, this launch includes several improvements in vector search capabilities. First, Z-score normalization improves hybrid search reliability by reducing the impact of outliers and different score scales. Finally, you can now boost efficiency of searches using memory-optimized search that enables the Faiss engine to operate efficiently by memory-mapping the index file and using the operating system's file cache to serve search requests.\n \nFor information on upgrading to OpenSearch 3.1, please see the documentation. OpenSearch 3.1 is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon OpenSearch Service is available.",
