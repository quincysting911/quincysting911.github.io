      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Serverless now supports backup and restore through the AWS Management Console. OpenSearch Serverless automatically backs up all collections and indexes in your account every hour and retains backups for 14 days. You can restore backups using either the API or the AWS Console. This feature is enabled by default and requires no configuration. For more information, see Working with snapshots in the Amazon OpenSearch Serverless Developer Guide.\n  Please refer to the AWS Regional Services List for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability. To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see the documentation.",

      "description": "AWS Cost Optimization Hub, a feature within the Billing and Cost Management Console, now supports a Cost Efficiency metric that helps you measure and track cloud cost efficiency over time across your organization. This metric automatically calculates the percentage of your cloud spend that can be optimized by considering rightsizing, idle, and commitment recommendations, allowing you to establish consistent cost savings benchmarks, set performance goals, and track progress to maximize your return on cloud investments.\n  AWS Cost Optimization Hub provides you with a measure of your cost efficiency by dividing aggregated estimated monthly savings of your cost optimization opportunities by your optimizable spend. You can track this metric over time across your organization to understand and benchmark your cost efficiency. With daily refreshes, the metric provides daily insights into optimization progress, showing score improvements when you implement cost-saving recommendations and score decreases when inefficient resources are provisioned.\n  Cost efficiency is now available in AWS Cost Optimization Hub across all AWS Regions where AWS Cost Optimization Hub is supported. To get started with cost efficiency metric, please visit the user guide and blog.",

      "description": "In this post, we explore how Metagenomi built a scalable database and search solution for over 1 billion protein vectors using LanceDB and Amazon S3. The solution enables rapid enzyme discovery by transforming proteins into vector embeddings and implementing a serverless architecture that combines AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon S3 for efficient nearest neighbor searches.",
