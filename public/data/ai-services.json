      "description": "Amazon Neptune Analytics is now available in the AWS Canada (Central) and Australia (Sydney) Regions. You can now create and manage Neptune Analytics graphs in the AWS Canada (Central) and Australia (Sydney) Regions and run advanced graph analytics and vector similarity search.\n  Neptune Analytics is a memory-optimized graph database engine for analytics. With Neptune Analytics, you can get insights and find trends by processing large amounts of graph data in seconds. To analyze graph data quickly and easily, Neptune Analytics stores large graph datasets in memory. It supports a library of optimized graph analytic algorithms, low-latency graph queries, and vector search capabilities within graph traversals. Neptune Analytics is an ideal choice for investigatory, exploratory, or data-science workloads that require fast iteration for data, analytical and algorithmic processing, or vector search on graph data. It complements Amazon Neptune Database, a popular managed graph database. To perform intensive analysis, you can load the data from a Neptune Database graph or snapshot into Neptune Analytics. You can also load graph data that's stored in Amazon S3.\n  To get started, you can create a new Neptune Analytics graphs using the AWS Management Console, or AWS CLI. For more information on pricing and region availability, refer to the Neptune pricing page and AWS Region Table.",

      "description": "At Vanguard, we faced significant challenges with our legacy mainframe system that limited our ability to deliver modern, personalized customer experiences. Our centralized database architecture created performance bottlenecks and made it difficult to scale services independently for our millions of personal and institutional investors. In this post, we show you how we modernized our data architecture using Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS).",

      "description": "AWS Lambda cold start latency can impact performance for latency-sensitive applications, with function initialization being the primary contributor to startup delays. Lambda SnapStart addresses this challenge by reducing cold start times from several seconds to sub-second performance for Java, Python, and .NET runtimes with minimal code changes. This post explains SnapStart's underlying mechanisms and provides performance optimization recommendations for applications using this feature.",
