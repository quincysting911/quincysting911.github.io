      "title": "Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling now supports predictive scaling in six more regions",
      "description": "Customers can now enable predictive scaling for their Auto Scaling groups (ASGs) in six more regions: Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Israel (Tel Aviv), Canada West (Calgary), Europe (Spain), and Europe (Zurich). Predictive Scaling can proactively scale out your ASGs to be ready for upcoming demand. This allows you to avoid the need to over-provision capacity, resulting in lower EC2 cost, while ensuring your application’s responsiveness. To see the list of all supported AWS public regions and AWS GovCloud (US) regions, click here.\n  Predictive Scaling is appropriate for applications that experience recurring patterns of steep demand changes, such as early morning spikes when business resumes. It learns from the past patterns and launches instances in advance of predicted demand, giving instances time to warm up. Predictive scaling enhances existing Auto Scaling policies, such as Target Tracking or Simple Scaling, so that your applications scale based on both real-time metrics and historic patterns. You can preview how Predictive Scaling works with your ASG by using the “Forecast Only” mode.\n  Predictive Scaling is available as a scaling policy type through AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), EC2 Auto Scaling Management Console, AWS CloudFormation and AWS SDKs. To learn more, visit the Predictive Scaling page in the EC2 Auto Scaling documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudWatch now offers interactive incident report generation, enabling customers to create comprehensive post-incident analysis reports in minutes. The new capability, available within CloudWatch investigations, automatically gathers and correlates your telemetry data, as well as your input and any actions taken during an investigation, and produces a streamlined incident report.\n  Using the new feature you can automatically capture critical operational telemetry, service configurations, and investigation findings to generate detailed reports. Reports include executive summaries, timeline of events, impact assessments, and actionable recommendations. These reports help you better identify patterns, implement preventive measures, and continuously improve your operational posture through structured post incident analysis.\n  The incident report generation feature is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Spain), and Europe (Stockholm).\n  You can create their first incident report by first creating a CloudWatch investigation and then clicking “Incident report”. To learn more about this new feature, visit the CloudWatch incident reports documentation.",
