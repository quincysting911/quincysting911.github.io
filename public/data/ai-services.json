      "description": "In this post, we explore how Metagenomi built a scalable database and search solution for over 1 billion protein vectors using LanceDB and Amazon S3. The solution enables rapid enzyme discovery by transforming proteins into vector embeddings and implementing a serverless architecture that combines AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon S3 for efficient nearest neighbor searches.",
