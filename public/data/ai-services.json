      "description": "Amazon Neptune Analytics is now available in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region. You can now create and manage Neptune Analytics graphs in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region and run advanced graph analytics.\n  Neptune Analytics is a memory-optimized graph database engine for analytics. With Neptune Analytics, you can get insights and find trends by processing large amounts of graph data in seconds. To analyze graph data quickly and easily, Neptune Analytics stores large graph datasets in memory. It supports a library of optimized graph analytic algorithms, low-latency graph queries, and vector search capabilities within graph traversals. Neptune Analytics is an ideal choice for investigatory, exploratory, or data-science workloads that require fast iteration for data, analytical and algorithmic processing, or vector search on graph data. It complements Amazon Neptune Database, a popular managed graph database. To perform intensive analysis, you can load the data from a Neptune Database graph or snapshot into Neptune Analytics. You can also load graph data that's stored in Amazon S3.\n  To get started, you can create a new Neptune Analytics graphs using the AWS Management Console, or AWS CLI. For more information on pricing and region availability, refer to the Neptune pricing page.",

      "description": "Today, AWS announces the general availability of new capabilities within AWS Billing and Cost Management that enable customers to manage their AWS spend across multiple organizations through a single AWS account. Customers can now share custom billing views containing cost management data with other AWS accounts outside their organization. Additionally, customers can combine multiple custom billing views to create new consolidated views. These features enable FinOps teams to create custom billing views containing cost management data for multiple organizations. These views can then be used to access cost management data across multiple organizations through Cost Explorer or set up budgets to monitor AWS costs.\n \nWith the new custom billing view capabilities, you can create consolidated views of cost management data spanning multiple organizations that can be accessed using AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets, allowing you to monitor, analyze, and forecast spending patterns across multiple organizations. This helps customers operating multiple subsidiaries or business units as separate organizations on AWS manage their AWS spend through a single AWS account.\n \nSupport for custom billing views containing cost management data for multiple organizations is available in all AWS Regions, excluding AWS GovCloud Regions and the AWS China Regions. To get started with custom billing views, visit Billing View within the Cost Management Preferences page in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and create a new custom billing view. To get started visit the Billing View user guide.",

      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion now supports cross-account ingestion for push-based sources such as HTTP and OpenTelemetry (OTel). With this launch, customers can easily share OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines across AWS accounts without relying on additional configurations like VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway.\n \nThis capability makes it simpler for organizations with multiple accounts to centralize observability and analytics workflows. For example, a central logging team can create ingestion pipelines and grant access to development teams across different accounts, enabling them to ingest logs, metrics, and traces directly into OpenSearch domains or OpenSearch Serverless collections. This reduces operational overhead and lowers the cost of sharing ingestion pipelines across accounts.\n \nCross-account ingestion for Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion is available today in all AWS regions where OpenSearch Ingestion is offered. Customers can get started by creating resource policies in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI, and then enabling pipeline endpoints from their VPCs to ingest data seamlessly.\n \nTo learn more about this feature, see the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide and the launch blog.",
