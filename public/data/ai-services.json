      "description": "At Vanguard, we faced significant challenges with our legacy mainframe system that limited our ability to deliver modern, personalized customer experiences. Our centralized database architecture created performance bottlenecks and made it difficult to scale services independently for our millions of personal and institutional investors. In this post, we show you how we modernized our data architecture using Amazon Redshift as our Operational Read-only Data Store (ORDS).",

      "description": "In this post, we explore how Metagenomi built a scalable database and search solution for over 1 billion protein vectors using LanceDB and Amazon S3. The solution enables rapid enzyme discovery by transforming proteins into vector embeddings and implementing a serverless architecture that combines AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, and Amazon S3 for efficient nearest neighbor searches.",

      "description": "AWS Lambda cold start latency can impact performance for latency-sensitive applications, with function initialization being the primary contributor to startup delays. Lambda SnapStart addresses this challenge by reducing cold start times from several seconds to sub-second performance for Java, Python, and .NET runtimes with minimal code changes. This post explains SnapStart's underlying mechanisms and provides performance optimization recommendations for applications using this feature.",
