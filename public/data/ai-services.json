      "description": "Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browser now supports branding customization, enabling you to create a consistent, branded experience that helps you align with your organization's visual identity. This feature allows you to customize the sign-in and session loading screens that appear to your end users by modifying visual elements and text content to maintain brand consistency across all user touch points.\n  You can personalize the sign-in and session loading experience by uploading your organization's favicon, logo, and wallpaper, selecting color themes, and customizing the welcome message , the browser tab title, and other text fields in all 11 languages supported by the service. You can also modify the \"Contact Us\" link to redirect to your organization's support page and add a Terms of Service page that users must acknowledge before starting a session. All customization settings are designed to meet WCAG AA accessibility and contrast requirements.\n  This feature is available at no additional cost in 10 AWS Regions, including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt, London, Ireland), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo, Mumbai, Sydney, Singapore). WorkSpaces Secure Browser offers pay-as-you go pricing.\n  To get started, visit the Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browser console to configure your branding settings. For more information, see the branding customization section in the Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browser’s documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) now offers enhanced observability for your snapshot exports to Amazon S3, providing detailed insights into export progress, failures, and performance for each task. These notifications enable you to monitor your exports with greater granularity and enables more predictability.\n  With snapshot export to S3, you can export data from your RDS database snapshots to Apache Parquet format in your Amazon S3 bucket. This launch introduces four new event types, including current export progress and table-level notifications for long-running tables, providing more granular visibility into your snapshot export performance and recommendations for troubleshooting export operation issues. Additionally, you can view export progress, such as the number of tables exported and pending, along with exported data sizes, enabling you to better plan your operations and workflows. You can subscribe to these events through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive notifications and view the export events through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDK.\n  This feature is available for RDS PostgreSQL, RDS MySQL, and RDS MariaDB engines in all Commercial Regions where RDS is generally available.\n  To learn more about the new event types, see Event categories in RDS.",
