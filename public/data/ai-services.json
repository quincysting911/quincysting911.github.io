      "title": "Introducing AWS DevOps Agent (preview), frontier agent for operational excellence",
      "description": "We're excited to launch AWS DevOps Agent in preview, a frontier agent that resolves and proactively prevents incidents, continuously improving reliability and performance of applications in AWS, multicloud, and hybrid environments. AWS DevOps Agent investigates incidents and identifies operational improvements as an experienced DevOps engineer would: by learning your resources and their relationships, working with your observability tools, runbooks, code repositories, and CI/CD pipelines, and correlating telemetry, code, and deployment data across all of them to understand the relationships between your application resources.\n \nAWS DevOps Agent autonomously triages incidents and guides teams to rapid resolution to reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR). AWS DevOps Agent begins investigating the moment an alert comes in, whether at 2 AM or during peak hours, to quickly restore your application to optimal performance. It analyzes patterns across historical incidents to provide actionable recommendations that strengthen key areas including observability, infrastructure optimization, and deployment pipeline enhancement. AWS DevOps Agent helps access the untapped insights in your operational data and tools without changing your workflows.\n \nAWS DevOps Agent is available at no additional cost during preview in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. To learn more, read the AWS News Blog and see getting started.",

      "description": "You can now build billion-scale vector databases in under an hour on Amazon OpenSearch Service with GPU-acceleration, and auto-optimize vector indexes for optimal trade-offs between search quality, speed and cost.\n  Previously, large-scale vector indexes took days to build, and optimizing them required experts to spend weeks of manual tuning. The time, cost and effort weighed down innovation velocity, and customers forwent cost and performance optimizations. You can now run serverless, auto-optimize jobs to generate optimization recommendations. You simply specify search latency and recall requirements, and these jobs will evaluate index configurations (k-NN algorithms, quantization, and engine settings) automatically. Then, you can use vector GPU-acceleration to build an optimized index up to 10X faster at a quarter of the indexing cost. Serverless GPUs dynamically activate and accelerate your domain or collection, so you’re only billed when you benefit from speed boosts—all done without you managing GPU instances.\n  These capabilities help you scale AI applications including semantic search, recommendation engines, and agentic systems more efficiently. By simplifying and accelerating the time to build large-scale, optimized vector databases, your team will be empowered to innovate faster.\n  Vector GPU-acceleration is available for vector collections and OpenSearch 3.1+ domains in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Paciﬁc (Sydney), Europe (Ireland), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Regions. Vector auto-optimize is available for vector collections and OpenSearch 2.17+ domains in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Paciﬁc (Mumbai), Asia Paciﬁc (Singapore), Asia Paciﬁc (Sydney), Asia Paciﬁc (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt) and Europe (Ireland) Regions. Learn more.",

      "description": "Today, AWS announces Database Savings Plans, a new flexible pricing model that helps you save up to 35% in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) over a one-year term with no upfront payment.\n  Database Savings Plans automatically apply to eligible serverless and provisioned instance usage regardless of supported engine, instance family, size, deployment option, or AWS Region. For example, with Database Savings Plans, you can change between Aurora db.r7g and db.r8g instances, shift a workload from EU (Ireland) to US (Ohio), modernize from Amazon RDS for Oracle to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL or from RDS to Amazon DynamoDB and still benefit from discounted pricing offered by Database Savings Plans.\n  Database Savings Plans will be available starting today in all AWS Regions, except China Regions, with support for Amazon Aurora, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility), Amazon Neptune, Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), Amazon Timestream, and AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).\n  You can get started with Database Savings Plans from the AWS Billing and Cost Management Console or by using the AWS CLI. To realize the largest savings, you can make a commitment to Savings Plans by using purchase recommendations provided in the console. For a more customized analysis, you can use the Savings Plans Purchase Analyzer to estimate potential cost savings for custom purchase scenarios.

      "description": "AWS Transform is expanding its capability from the .NET modernization agent to now include the full-stack Windows modernization agent that handles both .NET applications and their associated databases. The new agent automates the transformation of .NET applications and Microsoft SQL Server databases to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and deploys them to containers on Amazon ECS or Amazon EC2 Linux. AWS Transform accelerates full-stack Windows modernization by 5x across application and database layers, while reducing operating costs by up to 70%.\n  With AWS Transform, customers can accelerate their full-stack modernization journey through automated discovery, transformation, and deployment. The full-stack Windows modernization agent scans Microsoft SQL Server databases in Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS instances, and it scans .NET application code from source repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure Repos) to create customized, editable modernization plans. It automatically transforms SQL Server schemas to Aurora PostgreSQL and migrates databases to new or existing Aurora PostgreSQL target clusters. For .NET application transformation, the agent updates database connections in the source code and modifies database access code written in Entity Framework and ADO.NET to be compatible with Aurora PostgreSQL—all in a unified workflow with human supervision. All the transformed code is committed to a new repository branch. Finally, the transformed application along with the databases can be deployed into a new or existing environment to validate the transformed applications and databases. Customers can monitor transformation progress through worklog updates and interactive chat, and they can use the detailed transformation summaries for next steps recommendations and for easy handoff to AI code companions.\n  AWS Transform for full-stack Windows modernization is available in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region.\n  To learn more, visit the overview page and AWS Transform documentation.",
