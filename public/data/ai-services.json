      "title": "AI Troubleshooting in the AWS Support Center Console now supports 7 additional languages",
      "description": "AI troubleshooting in the AWS Support Center Console is now available in seven languages in addition to English: Japanese, Korean, Mandarin (Simplified), Mandarin (Traditional), Spanish, Portuguese, French. AWS Support Center Console is the primary interface where customers manage their AWS support experience, including creating and tracking support cases. Previously, AI troubleshooting capabilities were only available in English, creating a barrier for customers who prefer to work in their native language. With this launch, customers can now interact with AI-powered troubleshooting assistance in their preferred language.\n  AWS Support's AI troubleshooting helps customers resolve issues faster by providing immediate, contextual recommendations while they create a support case. For example, a Japanese developer troubleshooting an EC2 connectivity issue can now receive AI-generated insights and potential solutions in Japanese, reducing the time needed to understand and implement fixes. This capability is seamlessly integrated into the support experience and is available to all customers regardless of support plan, ensuring that language is no longer a barrier to self-service support.\n  All customers regardless of support plan can access the experience by selecting a supported language in their console settings and clicking the “Try it now” link in the banner at the top of the AWS Support Center Console.",
