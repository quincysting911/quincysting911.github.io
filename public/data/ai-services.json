      "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) now offers enhanced observability for your snapshot exports to Amazon S3, providing detailed insights into export progress, failures, and performance for each task. These notifications enable you to monitor your exports with greater granularity and enables more predictability.\n  With snapshot export to S3, you can export data from your RDS database snapshots to Apache Parquet format in your Amazon S3 bucket. This launch introduces four new event types, including current export progress and table-level notifications for long-running tables, providing more granular visibility into your snapshot export performance and recommendations for troubleshooting export operation issues. Additionally, you can view export progress, such as the number of tables exported and pending, along with exported data sizes, enabling you to better plan your operations and workflows. You can subscribe to these events through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive notifications and view the export events through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDK.\n  This feature is available for RDS PostgreSQL, RDS MySQL, and RDS MariaDB engines in all Commercial Regions where RDS is generally available.\n  To learn more about the new event types, see Event categories in RDS.",
