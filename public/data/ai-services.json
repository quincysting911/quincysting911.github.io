      "title": "Amazon OpenSearch Serverless adds AWS PrivateLink for management console",
      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Serverless now supports AWS PrivateLink for secure and private connectivity to management console. With AWS PrivateLink, you can establish a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and Amazon OpenSearch Serverless to create, manage, and configure your OpenSearch Serverless resources without using the public internet. By enabling private network connectivity, this enhancement eliminates the need to use public IP addresses or relying solely on firewall rules to access OpenSearch Serverless. With this feature release the OpenSearch Serverless management and data operations can be securely accessed through PrivateLinks. Data ingestion and query operations on collections still requires OpenSearch Serverless provided VPC endpoint configuration for private connectivity as described in the OpenSearch Serverless VPC developer guide.\n  You can use PrivateLink connections in all AWS Regions where Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is available. Creating VPC endpoints on AWS PrivateLink will incur additional charges; refer to AWS PrivateLink pricing page for details. You can get started by creating an AWS PrivateLink interface endpoint for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or AWS CloudFormation. To learn more, refer to the documentation on creating an interface VPC endpoint for management console.\n  Please refer to the AWS Regional Services List for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability. To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see the documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Aurora DSQL now provides statement-level cost estimates in query plans, giving developers immediate insight into the resources consumed by individual SQL statements. This enhancement surfaces Distributed Processing Unit (DPU) usage estimates directly within the query plan output, helping developers identify workload cost drivers, tune query performance, and better forecast resource usage.\n  With this launch, Aurora DSQL appends per-category (compute, read, write, and multi-Region write) and total estimated DPU usage at the end of the EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE plan output. The feature complements CloudWatch metrics by providing fine-grained, real-time visibility into query costs.\n  Aurora DSQL support for DPU usage in EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE plans is available in all Regions where Aurora DSQL is available. To get started, visit the Aurora DSQL Understanding DPUs in EXPLAIN ANALYZE docmentation.",

      "description": "AWS Cost Optimization Hub, a feature within the Billing and Cost Management Console, now supports a Cost Efficiency metric that helps you measure and track cloud cost efficiency over time across your organization. This metric automatically calculates the percentage of your cloud spend that can be optimized by considering rightsizing, idle, and commitment recommendations, allowing you to establish consistent cost savings benchmarks, set performance goals, and track progress to maximize your return on cloud investments.\n  AWS Cost Optimization Hub provides you with a measure of your cost efficiency by dividing aggregated estimated monthly savings of your cost optimization opportunities by your optimizable spend. You can track this metric over time across your organization to understand and benchmark your cost efficiency. With daily refreshes, the metric provides daily insights into optimization progress, showing score improvements when you implement cost-saving recommendations and score decreases when inefficient resources are provisioned.\n  Cost efficiency is now available in AWS Cost Optimization Hub across all AWS Regions where AWS Cost Optimization Hub is supported. To get started with cost efficiency metric, please visit the user guide and blog.",
