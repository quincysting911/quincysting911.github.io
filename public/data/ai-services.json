      "description": "You can now build billion-scale vector databases in under an hour on Amazon OpenSearch Service with GPU-acceleration, and auto-optimize vector indexes for optimal trade-offs between search quality, speed and cost.\n  Previously, large-scale vector indexes took days to build, and optimizing them required experts to spend weeks of manual tuning. The time, cost and effort weighed down innovation velocity, and customers forwent cost and performance optimizations. You can now run serverless, auto-optimize jobs to generate optimization recommendations. You simply specify search latency and recall requirements, and these jobs will evaluate index configurations (k-NN algorithms, quantization, and engine settings) automatically. Then, you can use vector GPU-acceleration to build an optimized index up to 10X faster at a quarter of the indexing cost. Serverless GPUs dynamically activate and accelerate your domain or collection, so you’re only billed when you benefit from speed boosts—all done without you managing GPU instances.\n  These capabilities help you scale AI applications including semantic search, recommendation engines, and agentic systems more efficiently. By simplifying and accelerating the time to build large-scale, optimized vector databases, your team will be empowered to innovate faster.\n  Vector GPU-acceleration is available for vector collections and OpenSearch 3.1+ domains in US East (N.

      "description": "AWS Transform is expanding its capability from the .NET modernization agent to now include the full-stack Windows modernization agent that handles both .NET applications and their associated databases. The new agent automates the transformation of .NET applications and Microsoft SQL Server databases to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and deploys them to containers on Amazon ECS or Amazon EC2 Linux. AWS Transform accelerates full-stack Windows modernization by 5x across application and database layers, while reducing operating costs by up to 70%.\n  With AWS Transform, customers can accelerate their full-stack modernization journey through automated discovery, transformation, and deployment. The full-stack Windows modernization agent scans Microsoft SQL Server databases in Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS instances, and it scans .NET application code from source repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure Repos) to create customized, editable modernization plans. It automatically transforms SQL Server schemas to Aurora PostgreSQL and migrates databases to new or existing Aurora PostgreSQL target clusters. For .NET application transformation, the agent updates database connections in the source code and modifies database access code written in Entity Framework and ADO.NET to be compatible with Aurora PostgreSQL—all in a unified workflow with human supervision. All the transformed code is committed to a new repository branch. Finally, the transformed application along with the databases can be deployed into a new or existing environment to validate the transformed applications and databases. Customers can monitor transformation progress through worklog updates and interactive chat, and they can use the detailed transformation summaries for next steps recommendations and for easy handoff to AI code companions.\n  AWS Transform for full-stack Windows modernization is available in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region.\n  To learn more, visit the overview page and AWS Transform documentation.",
