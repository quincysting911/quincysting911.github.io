      "description": "Modern generative AI applications often need to stream large language model (LLM) outputs to users in real-time. Instead of waiting for a complete response, streaming delivers partial results as they become available, which significantly improves the user experience for chat interfaces and long-running AI tasks. This post compares three serverless approaches to handle Amazon Bedrock LLM streaming on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which helps you choose the best fit for your application.",

      "description": "AWS Organizations Tag Policies announces Reporting for Required Tags, a new validation check that proactively ensures your CloudFormation, Terraform, and Pulumi deployments include the required tags critical to your business. Your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) operations can now be automatically validated against tag policies to ensure tagging consistency across your AWS environments. With this, you can ensure compliance for your IaC deployments in two simple steps: 1) define your tag policy, and 2) enable validation in each IaC tool.\n  Tag Policies enables you to enforce consistent tagging across your AWS accounts with proactive compliance, governance, and control. With this launch, you can specify mandatory tag keys in your tag policies, and enforce guardrails for your IaC deployments. For example, you can define a tag policy that all EC2 instances in your IaC templates must have “Environment”, “Owner”, and “Application” as required tag keys. You can start validation by activating AWS::TagPolicies::TaggingComplianceValidator Hook in CloudFormation, adding validation logic in your Terraform plan, or activating aws-organizations-tag-policies pre-built policy pack in Pulumi. Once configured, all CloudFormation, Terraform, and Pulumi deployments in the target account will be automatically validated and/or enforced against your tag policies, ensuring that resources like EC2 instances include the required \"Environment\", \"Owner\", and \"Application\" tags.\n  You can use Reporting for Required Tags feature via AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS Software Development Kit. This feature is available with AWS Organizations Tag Policies in AWS Regions where Tag Policies is available. To learn more, visit Tag Policies documentation. To learn how to set up validation and enforcement, see the user guide for CloudFormation, this user guide for Terraform, and this blog post for Pulumi.",

      "description": "Application Load Balancer (ALB) now offers Target Optimizer, a new feature that allows you to enforce a maximum number of concurrent requests on a target.\n  With Target Optimizer, you can fine-tune your application stack so that targets receive only the number of requests they can process, achieving higher request success rate, more target utilization, and lower latency. This is particularly useful for compute-intensive workloads. For example, if you have applications that perform complex data processing or inference, you can configure each target to receive as few as one request at a time, ensuring the number of concurrent requests is in line with the target's processing capabilities.\n  You can enable this feature by creating a new target group with a target control port. Once enabled, the feature works with the help of an agent provided by AWS that you run on your targets that tracks request concurrency. For deployments that include multiple target groups per ALB, you have the flexibility to configure this capability for each target group individually.\n  You can enable Target Optimizer through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, and AWS APIs. ALB Target Optimizer is available in all AWS Commercial Regions, AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, and AWS China Regions. Traffic to target groups that enable Target Optimizer generates more LCU usage than regular target groups. For more information, see the pricing page, launch blog, and ALB User Guide.",

RabbitMQ 4.2 also includes various bug fixes and performance improvements for throughput and memory management.\n  A key highlight of RabbitMQ 4.2 is the support of AMQP 1.0 as a core protocol offering enhanced features like modified outcome which allow consumers to modify message annotations before requeueing or dead lettering, and granular flow control, which offers benefits including letting a client application dynamically adjust how many messages it wants to receive from a specific queue. Amazon MQ has also introduced configurable resource limits for RabbitMQ 4.2 brokers which you can modify based on your application requirements. Starting from RabbitMQ 4.0, mirroring of classic queues is no longer supported. Non-replicated classic queues are still supported. Quorum queues are the only replicated and durable queue type supported on RabbitMQ 4.2 brokers, and now offer message priorities in addition to consumer priorities.\n  To start using RabbitMQ 4.2 on Amazon MQ, simply select RabbitMQ 4.2 when creating a new broker using the m7g instance type through the AWS Management console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Amazon MQ automatically manages patch version upgrades for your RabbitMQ 4.2 brokers, so you need to only specify the major.minor version.

A higher fan-out limit lets customers attach many more independent, low-latency, high-throughput consumers to the same stream—unlocking parallel analytics, ML pipelines, compliance workflows, and multi-team architectures without creating extra streams or causing throughput contention. On-demand Advantage is an account-level setting that unlocks more capabilities and provides a different pricing structure for all on-demand streams in an AWS Region. On-demand Advantage offers data usage with 60% lower pricing compared to On-demand Standard, with data ingest at $0.032/GB, data retrieval at $0.016/GB, and enhanced fan-out data retrieval at $0.016/GB. High fan-out workloads are most cost effective with On-demand Advantage.\n  Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale. Enhanced fan-out is an Amazon Kinesis Data Streams feature that enables consumers to receive records from a data stream with dedicated throughput of up to 2 MB of data per second per shard, and this throughput automatically scales with the number of shards in a stream. A consumer that uses enhanced fan-out doesn't have to contend with other consumers that are receiving data from the stream. For accounts with On-demand Advantage enabled, you can continue to use the existing Kinesis API RegisterStreamConsumer to register new consumers to use enhanced fan-out up to the new 50 limit.\n  Support for enhanced fan-out consumers is available in the AWS Regions listed here.

The raw query string capability provides access to the complete, unprocessed query string as received from the viewer, preserving special characters and encoding that may be altered during standard parsing. Advanced origin overrides solve critical challenges for complex application infrastructures by allowing you to customize SSL/TLS handshake parameters, including Server Name Indication (SNI). For example, multi-tenant setups may override SNI where CloudFront connects through CNAME chains that resolve to servers with different certificate domains.\n  These new CloudFront Functions capabilities are available at no additional charge in all CloudFront edge location.

This feature allows customers to update the root volume of an EC2 instance without stopping or terminating the instance, while preserving other associated instance resources. The capability reduces operational complexity, simplifies software patching, and streamlines recovery from corrupted root volumes.\n  Customers use instance refresh to update the instances in their Auto Scaling groups (ASGs). This feature can be useful when customers want to migrate their instances to new instance types to take advantage of the latest improvements and optimizations. Traditionally, this process involved terminating older instances and launching new ones in a controlled manner. The new ReplaceRootVolume strategy transforms how customers manage instance lifecycles and software updates in their ASGs by enabling EC2 Auto Scaling service to replace the root Amazon EBS volume for running instances without stopping them. Organizations can now implement OS-level updates and security patches more efficiently without worrying about capacity management. This is especially valuable for workloads that use specialized instance types like Mac or GPU instances.

Customers can now configure a way to retain their instances when their termination lifecycle hooks fail or timeout, providing greater confidence in managing instances for graceful shutdown.\n  You can add lifecycle hooks to an Auto Scaling group (ASG) to perform custom actions when an instance enters a wait state. You can choose a target service (e.g., Amazon EventBridge or AWS Lambda) to perform these actions depending on your preferred development approach. Customers use ASG lifecycle hooks to save application state, properly close database connections, back up important data from local storage, delete sensitive data/credentials, or deregister from service discovery before instance termination. Previously, both default results—continue and abandon—led to ASG terminating instances when the lifecycle hook timeout elapsed or if an unexpected failure occurred. With the new instance lifecycle policy, you can now configure retention-triggers to keep your instances in a retained state for manual intervention until you're ready to terminate them again.

      "description": "Amazon EC2 now provides Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ancestry that enables you to trace the complete lineage of any AMI, from its immediate parent through each preceding generation back to the root AMI. This capability gives you complete transparency into where your AMIs originated and how they've been propagated across regions.\n  Previously, tracking AMI lineage required manual processes, custom tagging strategies, and complex record-keeping across regions. This approach was error-prone and difficult to maintain at scale, especially when AMIs were copied across multiple regions. Now, with AMI ancestry, you have full visibility into the entire generational chain of any AMI in your environment. AMI ancestry addresses critical use cases such as tracking AMIs for compliance with internal policies, identifying all potentially vulnerable AMIs when security issues are discovered in the ancestral chain, and maintaining complete visibility of an AMI’s origin across regions.\n  AMI ancestry can be accessed using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or Console. This capability is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions, including AWS China and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more, please visit our documentation here.",

      "description": "Amazon Connect outbound campaigns now offers campaign managers the ability to configure how long voice calls should ring—between a range of 15 and 60 seconds—before marking a call as “no answer” and moving to the next contact. Each contact also records when ringing began and ended for precise reporting and traceability.\n  When ring duration is static, businesses struggle to balance calling efficiency and customer reach. Calls that ring too briefly may miss customers who take longer to answer, while excessive ring times delay overall campaign pacing. This lack of control leads to inconsistent contact rates and reduced agent productivity.\n  With configurable ring time, campaign managers can tune dialing behavior to their audience for each campaign, use analytics to see exactly how long each call rang, and understand where connections were missed. This visibility helps identify patterns, refine calling strategies, and continuously improve campaign effectiveness.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage. This feature is available in AWS regions, including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London).\n  To learn more about configuring ring time for campaigns, visit our webpage.",

This capability allows customers to define how Reserved Instances and Savings Plans benefits are distributed among specific groups of accounts within their AWS organization, ensuring cost savings align with their business structure and accountability requirements.\n  RISP Group Sharing addresses a common challenge faced by enterprise customers managing AWS costs across multiple business units: for example, Reserved Instances and Savings Plans don't always benefit the teams that purchased them. With this feature, customers can create groups using AWS Cost Categories that reflect their organizational hierarchy—whether by business units, projects, geographical regions, or funding sources. The feature offers two sharing options: the Prioritized Group Sharing applies commitments to defined groups first, then shares unused capacity organization-wide, while the Restricted Group Sharing keeps commitments exclusively within defined groups for complete isolation when strict boundaries are required.\n  RISP Group Sharing is available now in all AWS Regions, except AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and the China Regions.\n  To get started with RISP Group Sharing, visit the Billing preferences from the AWS Billing and Cost Management Console and follow the guided setup to create your first Cost Category and configure sharing preferences.

These capabilities help developers identify issues, such as syntax errors, missing permissions, or configuration mismatches before deployment. It also provides a drift view that highlights differences between the current template and the deployed stack configuration. By integrating validation and real-time feedback directly into the authoring experience, the CloudFormation Language Server keeps developers in their flow state, turning infrastructure coding into a seamless experience, and improves infrastructure safety. This unified experience enables developers to move from design to deployment faster while maintaining compliance and best practices, spending more time building and less time troubleshooting.\n  The AWS CloudFormation Language Server is available in all AWS Commercial Regions where AWS CloudFormation is supported.

This enhancement allows you to fine-tune instance management based on your specific workload patterns and business requirements, helping you better balance cost optimization with operational needs.\n  ECS Managed Instances is a fully managed compute option that automatically provisions right-sized Amazon EC2 instances based on your workload requirements. Over time, your compute resources may drift from workload requirements due to changing traffic patterns or dynamic scaling. ECS Managed Instances continuously monitors and proactively optimizes costs by terminating idle Amazon EC2 instances not running any tasks, and consolidating tasks from underutilized instances onto other, right-sized instances, provisioning new instances if required. ECS uses a heuristic based delay for scaling-in your instances to deliver a balance of high availability and cost optimization. However, your workloads or business may have unique requirements. For example, you might need to retain instances for a longer time period to accommodate incoming batch jobs and minimize instance churn. Starting today, you can set the scaleInAfter configuration parameter to up to 60 minutes to align with your specific infrastructure optimization needs. You can also set the scaleInAfter to -1 to disable infrastructure optimization workflows, which will allow your instances to run until they are patched after 14 days.\n  You can use ECS API, console, SDK, CDK, CloudFormation to configure scaleInAfter parameter when creating or updating an ECS Managed Instances capacity provider. This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions. To learn more, review documentation and deep dive blog post.",

This launch simplifies building multi-tenant applications on Lambda, such as SaaS platforms for workflow automation or code execution.\n  Customers building multi-tenant applications have strict isolation requirements when running code or processing data for individual tenants or end-users. Previously, customers met these requirements by implementing custom solutions, such as creating dedicated Lambda functions per tenant and routing requests from individual tenants to their associated functions.

This launch extends Lambda’s isolation boundary from a single function to each tenant invoking that function.\n  To use the new tenant isolation mode, customers specify a unique tenant identifier when invoking their Lambda function. Lambda uses this identifier to route invocation requests to a function’s underlying execution environments and ensures that execution environments associated with a particular tenant are never used to serve requests from other tenants invoking the function.\n  The new tenant isolation mode for AWS Lambda is available in all AWS Regions, except Asia Pacific (New Zealand), AWS GovCloud (US), and China.

This capability is particularly valuable for organizations that must maintain strict isolation between their workloads and public network connectivity.\n  To establish a private connection, you create an interface Amazon VPC endpoint powered by AWS PrivateLink, which creates requester-managed network interfaces in each enabled subnet to serve as entry points for Directory Service API traffic. This feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Directory Service is supported. To learn more, see the AWS Directory Service documentation.",

You can browse and search topics within a cluster, quickly review replication settings and partition counts, and drill into individual topics to examine detailed configuration, partition-level information, and metrics. These console capabilities are powered by three new MSK APIs, ListTopics, DescribeTopic, and DescribeTopicPartitions that you can also use directly for programmatic access. The ListTopics API returns the list of all topics in a cluster, while the DescribeTopic and DescribeTopicPartitions APIs provide detailed configuration and partition information for a topic. All three APIs are available through the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs.\n  These MSK topic viewing capabilities are available for all Amazon MSK Provisioned clusters using Kafka version 3.6 and above across AWS regions where Amazon MSK is offered.

With this feature, security, compliance, and operations teams can efficiently monitor high-volume data access patterns without processing massive numbers of individual events.\n  Aggregation for data events streamlines security monitoring by consolidating high-volume AWS API activity into 5-minute summaries. These summaries highlight key trends like access frequency, error rates, and most-used actions, allowing teams to quickly identify patterns while maintaining access to detailed events when needed. Security teams can easily answer questions like \"How has this user's activity changed over the past week?\" or \"What are the top actions being performed on this critical resource?\" without having to scan through voluminous CloudTrail data events.\n  You can enable aggregation in your trails capturing data events through the AWS console or CLI, and choose from pre-built aggregation templates for API activity, resource access, and user activity summaries. For more information, see the CloudTrail trail documentation. You are charged for aggregations based on the number of CloudTrail data events that are analyzed to create the aggregation. For more information, visit the CloudTrail pricing page.\n  You can use CloudTrail aggregations for data in all commercial AWS Regions.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon Bedrock introduces two new inference service tiers to optimize costs and performance for different AI workloads. The new Flex tier offers cost-effective pricing for non-time-critical applications like model evaluations and content summarization while the Priority tier provides premium performance and preferential processing for mission-critical applications. For most models that support Priority Tier, customers can realize up to 25% better output tokens per second (OTPS) latency compared to standard tier. These join the existing Standard tier for everyday AI applications with reliable performance.\n \nThese service tiers address key challenges that organizations face when deploying AI at scale. The Flex tier is designed for non-interactive workloads that can tolerate longer latencies, making it ideal for model evaluations, content summarization, labeling and annotation, and multistep agentic workflow, and it’s priced at a discount relative to the Standard tier. During periods of high demand, Flex requests receive lower priority relative to the Standard tier. The Priority tier is an ideal fit for mission critical applications, real-time end-user interactions, and interactive experiences where consistent, fast responses are essential. During periods of high demand, Priority requests receive processing priority, at a premium price, over other service tiers. These new service tiers are available today for a range of leading foundation models, including OpenAI (gpt-oss-20b, gpt-oss-120b), DeepSeek (DeepSeek V3.1), Qwen3 (Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct, Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct, 32B dense, Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507), and Amazon Nova (Nova Pro and Nova Premier). With these new options, Amazon Bedrock helps customers gain greater control over balancing cost efficiency with performance requirements, enabling them to scale AI workloads economically while ensuring optimal user experiences for their most critical applications.\n \nFor more information about the AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Priority and Flex inference service tiers are available, see the AWS Regions table\n \nLearn more about service tiers in our News Blog and documentation.",

      "description": "Today, EC2 Auto Scaling is launching a new API, LaunchInstances, which gives customers more control and flexibility over how EC2 Auto Scaling provisions instances while providing instant feedback on capacity availability.\n  Customers use EC2 Auto Scaling for automated fleet management. With scaling policies, EC2 Auto Scaling can automatically add instances when demand spikes and remove them when traffic drops, ensuring customers' applications always have the right amount of compute. EC2 Auto Scaling also offers the ability to monitor and replace unhealthy instances. In certain use cases, customers may want to specify exactly where EC2 Auto Scaling should launch additional instances and need immediate feedback on capacity availability. The new LaunchInstances API allows customers to precisely control where instances are launched by specifying an override for any Availability Zone and/or subnet in an Auto Scaling group, while providing immediate feedback on capacity availability. This synchronous operation gives customers real-time insight into scaling operations, enabling them to quickly implement alternative strategies if needed. For additional flexibility, the API includes optional asynchronous retries to help reach the desired capacity.\n  This feature is now available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland), and Asia Pacific (Singapore), at no additional cost beyond standard EC2 and EBS usage. To get started, visit the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs. To learn more about this feature, visit the AWS documentation.",

R8gd and M8gd database instances offer improved price-performance. For example, Optimized Reads on R8gd instances deliver up to 165% better throughput and up to 120% better price-performance over R6g instances for Aurora PostgreSQL.\n  Optimized Reads uses local NVMe-based SSD block storage available on these instances to store ephemeral data, such as temporary tables, reducing data access to/from network-based storage and improving read latency and throughput. The result is improved query performance for complex queries and faster index rebuild operations. Aurora PostgreSQL Optimized Reads instances using the I/O-Optimized configuration additionally use the local storage to extend their caching capacity. Database pages that are evicted from the in-memory buffer cache are cached in local storage to speed subsequent retrieval of that data.\n  Customers can get started with Optimized Reads through the AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDK by modifying their existing Aurora and RDS databases or creating a new database using R8gd or M8gd instances. These instances are available in the US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Spain, Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Regions. For complete information on pricing and regional availability, please refer to the pricing page. For information on specific engine versions that support these DB instance types, please see the Aurora and RDS documentation.",
