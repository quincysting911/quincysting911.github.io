By offloading infrastructure operations to AWS, ECS Managed Instances helps you quickly launch and scale your workloads, while enhancing performance and reducing your total cost of ownership.\n  With ECS Managed Instances, you get the application performance you want and the simplicity you need. Simply define your task requirements such as the number of vCPUs, memory size, and CPU architecture, and Amazon ECS automatically provisions, configures and operates most optimal EC2 instances within your AWS account using AWS-controlled access. You can also specify desired instance types in Managed Instances Capacity Provider configuration, including GPU-accelerated, network-optimized, and burstable performance, to run your workloads on the instance families you prefer.\n  ECS Managed Instances dynamically scales EC2 instances to match your workload requirements and continuously optimizes task placement to reduce infrastructure costs. It also enhances your security posture through regular security patching initiated every 14 days. You can use EC2 event windows to schedule patching to occur within weekly maintenance windows, minimizing the risk of interruptions during critical hours.\n  ECS Managed Instances is now available in six AWS regions: US East (North Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Dublin), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). To get started with ECS Managed Instances, use the AWS Console, Amazon ECS MCP Server, or your favorite infrastructure-as-code tooling to enable it in a new or existing Amazon ECS cluster. You will be charged for the management of compute provisioned, in addition to your regular Amazon EC2 costs.

With this launch, Amazon ECS tasks and services can run using only IPv6 addresses, without requiring IPv4. This enables customers to deploy containerized applications in IPv6-only environments, scale without being limited by IPv4 address availability, and meet IPv6 compliance requirements through native IPv6 support in Amazon ECS.\n  Previously, Amazon ECS tasks always required an IPv4 address, even when launched in dual-stack subnets. This requirement could create scaling and management challenges for customers operating large fleets of containerized applications, where IPv4 address space became a bottleneck. With IPv6-only support, Amazon ECS tasks launched in IPv6-only subnets use only IPv6 addresses. This removes IPv4 as a dependency and helps organizations that must meet IPv6 adoption or regulatory mandates.\n  The feature works across all Amazon ECS launch types and can be used with awsvpc, bridge, and host networking modes. To get started, create IPv6-only subnets in your VPC and launch Amazon ECS services or tasks in those subnets. Amazon ECS automatically detects the configuration and provisions the appropriate networking. To learn more about IPv6-only task networking and supported AWS Regions, see the Amazon ECS task networking documentation for AWS Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type.

With this update, gp3 volumes can scale up to 64 TiB in size (4X the previous 16 TiB limit), up to 80,000 IOPS (5X the previous 16,000 IOPS limit), and up to 2,000 MiB/s throughput (2X the previous 1,000 MiB/s limit).\n  These expanded limits help reduce operational complexity for storage-intensive workloads by enabling gp3 volumes with larger capacity and higher performance. You can consolidate multiple striped volumes into a single gp3 volume, streamline architectures, and lower management overhead. The increased limits particularly benefit customers running containerized workloads with limited support for striping multiple volumes, applications that rely on single-volume architectures, and growing workloads approaching current gp3 limits.

These customers often face a difficult trade-off: setting sampling rates too low risks missing critical traces during incidents, while setting them too high unnecessarily increases observability costs during normal operations.            \n Today, with adaptive sampling, you can automatically adjust sampling rates within user-defined limits to ensure you capture the most important traces precisely when you need them. This helps development teams reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) during incidents by providing comprehensive trace data for root cause analysis, while maintaining cost-efficient sampling rates during normal operations. Adaptive sampling supports two approaches, Sampling Boost and Anomaly Span Capture. These can be applied independently or can be combined together. Customers can use Sampling Boost to temporarily increase sampling rates when anomalies are detected to capture complete traces and Anomaly Span Capture to ensures anomaly-related spans are always captured, even when the full trace isn't sampled.\n Adaptive sampling is currently available in all commercial regions where AWS X-Ray is offered. For more information, see the X-Ray documentation. and CloudWatch pricing page for X-ray pricing details.",

      "description": "Region switch in Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) is now available in the Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region. Region switch allows you to orchestrate the specific steps to operate your cross-AWS account application resources out of another AWS Region. It provides dashboards for real-time visibility into the recovery process and gathers data from across resources and accounts required for reporting to regulators and compliance teams. Region switch supports failover and failback for active/passive multi-Region approaches, and shift-away and return for active/active multi-Region approaches. When you create a Region switch plan, it is replicated to all the Regions your application operates in. This removes dependencies on the Region you are leaving for your recovery.\n  To get started, build a Region switch plan using the ARC console, API, or CLI. To learn more, visit the ARC Region switch documentation and pricing page.",

      "description": "Today, we are announcing the availability of Route 53 Resolver Query Logging in Asia Pacific (New Zealand), enabling you to log DNS queries that originate in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With query logging enabled, you can see which domain names have been queried, the AWS resources from which the queries originated - including source IP and instance ID - and the responses that were received. \n  Route 53 Resolver is the Amazon provided DNS server that is available by default in all Amazon VPCs. Route 53 Resolver responds to DNS queries from AWS resources within a VPC for public DNS records, Amazon VPC-specific DNS names, and Amazon Route 53 private hosted zones. With Route 53 Resolver Query Logging, customers can log DNS queries and responses for queries originating from within their VPCs, whether those queries are answered locally by Route 53 Resolver, or are resolved over the public internet, or are forwarded to on-premises DNS servers via Resolver Endpoints. You can share your query logging configurations across multiple accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). You can also choose to send your query logs to Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, or Amazon Data Firehose. \n  There is no additional charge to use Route 53 Resolver Query Logging, although you may incur usage charges from Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, or Amazon Data Firehose. To learn more about Route 53 Resolver Query Logging or to get started, visit the Route 53 Resolver product page or the Route 53 documentation.",

      "description": "Today, AWS eliminated the networking bandwidth burst duration limitations for Amazon EC2 I7i and I8g instances on sizes larger than 4xlarge. This update doubles the Network Bandwidth available at all times for i7i and i8g instances on sizes larger than 4xlarge. Previously, these instance sizes had a baseline bandwidth and used a network I/O credit mechanism to burst beyond their baseline bandwidth on a best effort basis. Today these instance sizes can sustain their maximum performance indefinitely. With this improvement, customers running memory and network intensive workloads on larger instance sizes can now consistently maintain their maximum network bandwidth without interruption, delivering more predictable performance for applications that require sustained high-throughput network connectivity. This change applies only to instance sizes larger than 4xlarge, while smaller instances will continue to operate with their existing baseline and burst bandwidth configurations.\n \nAmazon EC2 I7i and I8g instances are designed for I/O intensive workloads that require rapid data access and real-time latency from storage. These instances excel at handling transactional, real-time, distributed databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Hbase and NoSQL solutions like Aerospike, MongoDB, ClickHouse, and Apache Druid. They're also optimized for real-time analytics platforms such as Apache Spark, data lakehouse, and AI LLM pre-processing for training. These instances have up to 1.5 TiB of memory, and 45 TB local instance storage. They deliver up to 100 Gbps of network performance bandwidth, and 60 Gbps of dedicated bandwidth for Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS).\n \nTo learn more, see Amazon EC2 I7i and I8g instances.

      "description": "Amazon Redshift announces the general availability of Multidimensional Data Layouts (MDDL) that dynamically sort data based on actual query filters, accelerating query performance. Unlike traditional sorting methods that sort data based on fixed columns, MDDL sorts data based on query filters (for example, Sales in US), achieving up to 10x better end-to-end performance compared to using only optimal single-column sort keys for query workloads with repetitive query filters.\n  For each table with an AUTO sort key, which is the default for tables without an explicit sort key, Redshift analyzes the table’s query history and automatically selects either a single-column sort key or MDDL for your table, depending on potential performance improvements for your workload. Redshift with MDDL automatically constructs a multidimensional virtual sort key that co-locates rows typically accessed by the same queries. This virtual column, equivalent to a new sort key for the table, is subsequently used during query execution to skip data blocks and even skip scanning entire predicate columns. Redshift with MDDL provides a more expressive generalization of existing compound and interleaved sort keys that significantly improves the performance of table scans, especially when your query workload contains repetitive query filters. For pre-existing tables with manually defined sort keys, you can take advantage of MDDL by altering the sortkey of the table to AUTO.\n  MDDL is available in all AWS commercial regions where Redshift is available. To get started, read the documentation, blog, and Amazon Science publication to learn more about benchmarks on query performance improvements.",

IPv6 increases the number of available addresses by several orders of magnitude, so customers will no longer need to manage overlapping address spaces. Many devices and networks today already use IPv6, and now they can easily write to and read from data streams. FIPS-compliant endpoints help companies contracting with the US federal governments meet the FIPS security requirement to encrypt sensitive data in supported Regions.\n  Support for IPv6 with Kinesis Data Streams is now available in all Regions where Kinesis Data Streams is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) and China Regions.

      "description": "AWS Step Functions adds supports for IPv6. You can now send IPV6 traffic to AWS Step Functions via new dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints. AWS Step Functions is a visual workflow service that enables customers to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services. This enhancement addresses the growing need for IP addresses as the internet continues to expand, providing a larger address space than the traditional IPv4 format.\n  With IPv6 support, organizations modernizing their applications can now build serverless workflows without being constrained by limited IPv4 address space. The new dual-stack endpoints support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing IPv4 endpoints. Step Functions also supports IPv6 connectivity through PrivateLink interface Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints, enabling you to access the service privately without traversing the public internet. This enables organizations operating in IPv6 environments to natively integrate with Step Functions without requiring complex translation mechanisms between IPv6 and IPv4.\n  IPv6 support for AWS Step Functions is now generally available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California) as well as AWS GovCloud (US-East), and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, where AWS Step Functions is available.\n  To learn more about IPv6 support on AWS, visit the documentation page.",

This new feature enables organizations to implement high-quality vector search capabilities while significantly reducing operational costs.\n  With the introduction of Disk Optimized Vectors, customers can now choose between memory-optimized and disk-optimized vector storage options. The disk-optimized option delivers the same high accuracy and recall rates as memory-optimized vectors at lower cost. While this option may introduce slightly higher latency, it's ideal for use cases where sub-millisecond response times aren't critical such as semantic search applications, recommendation systems, and other AI-powered search scenarios.\n  Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, our fully managed deployment option, eliminates the complexities of infrastructure management for search and analytics workloads. The service automatically scales compute capacity, measured in OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs), based on your workload demands.\n \nPlease refer to the AWS Regional Services List for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability.

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now supports managed node autoscaling using Karpenter, enabling customers to automatically scale their clusters to meet dynamic inference and training demands. Real-time inference workloads require automatic scaling to address unpredictable traffic patterns and maintain service level agreements, while optimizing costs. However, organizations often struggle with the operational overhead of installing, configuring, and maintaining complex autoscaling solutions. HyperPod-managed node autoscaling eliminates the undifferentiated heavy lifting of Karpenter setup and maintenance, while providing integrated resilience and fault tolerance capabilities.\n  Autoscaling on HyperPod with Karpenter enables customers to achieve just-in-time provisioning that rapidly adapts GPU compute for inference traffic spikes. Customers can scale to zero nodes during low-demand periods without maintaining dedicated controller infrastructure and benefit from workload-aware node selection that optimizes instance types and costs. For inference workloads, this provides automatic capacity scaling to handle production traffic bursts, cost reduction through intelligent node consolidation during idle periods, and seamless integration with event-driven pod autoscalers like KEDA. Training workloads also benefit from automatic resource optimization during model development cycles. You can enable autoscaling on HyperPod using the UpdateCluster API with AutoScaling mode set to \"Enable\" and AutoScalerType set to \"Karpenter\".\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod EKS clusters are supported. To learn more about autoscaling on SageMaker HyperPod with Karpenter, see the user guide and blog.",

      "description": "Today AWS announced custom time periods for AWS Budgets, a new capability that lets you create budgets with flexible start and end dates. This enhancement allows you to define budget periods that align with your organization's specific needs, moving beyond traditional calendar-based periods like monthly, quarterly, or annual budgets.\n  Custom time periods help you accurately monitor costs for projects with specific duration and funding limits. For example, if you have a three-month development project starting mid-month, you can create a single budget for that exact time frame and receive alerts when spending approaches your thresholds. This eliminates the need to calculate and split your project budget across multiple calendar months or maintain separate spreadsheets to track time-bound initiatives.\n  Custom time periods in AWS Budgets is available today in all AWS commercial Regions, except the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and the China Regions.\n  To learn more about custom time periods in AWS Budgets, see Managing your costs with AWS Budgets in the AWS Billing User Guide.",

These improvements include expanded monitoring insights and advanced TLS Inspection features. These updates provide customers with enhanced visibility into their firewall's performance and stronger security measures for outbound connections.\n  The monitoring dashboard now provides deeper insights into traffic going to AWS services such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Backup, which can be sent over PrivateLink endpoints. The dashboard also gives visibility into top source and destination IP addresses based on packets and bytes processed. Customers can filter the dashboard based on IP addresses and protocol, enabling more targeted analysis of network traffic patterns.\n  To further strengthen security, AWS Network Firewall has introduced session holding for TLS Inspection. This feature prevents any TCP and TLS establishment packets from reaching destination servers until TLS protocol rules matching on Server Name Indication (SNI) have been evaluated. This enhancement provides stronger security controls for outbound traffic and helps protect against connections to potentially malicious targets. These new features are available in all AWS Regions where AWS Network Firewall is offered.\n  To learn more about these new features and other AWS Network Firewall capabilities, visit the AWS Network Firewall product page and the service documentation.",

Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
