Customers can create Amazon MSK Provisioned clusters in this region starting today.\n  Amazon MSK is a fully managed service for Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect that makes it easier for you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka as a data store. Amazon MSK is fully compatible with Apache Kafka, which enables you to more quickly migrate your existing Apache Kafka workloads to Amazon MSK with confidence or build new ones from scratch. With Amazon MSK, you spend more time building innovative streaming applications and less time managing Kafka clusters.\n  Amazon MSK offers two types of Apache Kafka provisioned broker - Standard brokers and Express brokers. Standard brokers offer the most flexibility to configure your cluster’s performance. You can configure availability, durability, throughput, and latency. You also control the storage configurations on your cluster and are responsible for managing storage provisioning and utilization. Express brokers are a new broker type for Amazon MSK Provisioned designed to deliver up to 3x more throughput per broker, scale up to 20x faster, up to 5x more partitions per broker, and reduce recovery time by 90% as compared to Standard brokers. Express brokers come pre-configured with Kafka best practices by default, support all Kafka APIs, and provide the same low-latency performance that Amazon MSK customers expect, so they can continue using existing client applications without any changes.\n  You can now create an MSK provisioned cluster with Standard or Express brokers in Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region through the Amazon MSK console or the Amazon CLI.

The new Gen6 stream classes provide a wider range of price performance options, while autoscaling enables customers to dynamically manage capacity scaling. \n  The seven new Gen6 stream classes available today are based on EC2 G6 instances powered by NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPUs, which provide up to 2x higher performance over Gen4 stream classes. The pro and ultra stream class deliver improved performance for graphics-intensive AAA games, while the medium and small stream class offer cost-efficient options for casual games. The gen6n_small stream class is available at $0.16/hour in us-east-2. \n  The enhanced autoscaling capabilities provide automatic capacity management that scales provisioned capacity dynamically with demand, helping customers optimize utilization and stream start time for new players.

Region switch saves hours of engineering effort and eliminates the operational overhead previously required to complete failover steps, create custom dashboards, and manually gather evidence of a successful recovery for applications across your organization and hosted in multiple AWS accounts. Today, we are announcing three new Region switch capabilities:\n  AWS GovCloud (US) support: ARC Region switch is now generally available in AWS GovCloud (US-East and US-West) Regions.\n  Plan execution reports: Region switch now automatically generates a comprehensive report from each plan execution and saves it to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice. Each report includes a detailed timeline of events for the recovery operation, resources in scope for the Region switch, alarm states for optional application status alarms, and recovery time objective (RTO) calculations. This eliminates the manual effort previously required to compile evidence and documentation for compliance officers and auditors.\n  DocumentDB global cluster execution blocks: Adding to the catalog of 9 execution blocks, Region switch now supports Amazon DocumentDB global cluster execution blocks for automated multi-Region database recovery. This feature allows you to orchestrate DocumentDB global cluster failover and switchover operations within your Region switch plans.\n  To get started, build a Region switch plan using the ARC console, API, or CLI.

      "description": "Today, AWS announces SOCI (Seekable Open Container Initiative) indexing support for Amazon SageMaker Studio, reducing container startup times by 30-50% when using custom images. Amazon SageMaker Studio is a fully integrated, browser-based environment for end-to-end machine learning development. SageMaker Studio provides pre-built container images for popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn that enable quick environment setup. However, when data scientists need to tailor environments for specific use cases with additional libraries, dependencies, or configurations, they can build and register custom container images with pre-configured components to ensure consistency across projects. As ML workloads become increasingly complex, these custom container images have grown in size, leading to startup times of several minutes that create a bottlenecks in iterative ML development where quick experimentation and rapid prototyping are essential.\n  SOCI indexing addresses this challenge by enabling lazy loading of container images, downloading only the necessary components to start applications with additional files loaded on-demand as needed. Instead of waiting several minutes for complete custom image downloads, users can begin productive work in seconds while the environment completes initialization in the background. To use SOCI indexing, create a SOCI index for your custom container image using tools like Finch CLI, nerdctl, or Docker with SOCI CLI, push the indexed image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and reference the image index URI when creating SageMaker Image resources.\n  SOCI indexing is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker Studio is available.

With the new feature, you can now batch messages together before routing that data set to downstream HTTP endpoints.\n  To efficiently process IoT messages using the new batching capability, connect your IoT devices to AWS IoT Core and define a HTTP rule action with your desired batch parameters. AWS IoT Core will then process incoming messages according to these specifications and route the messages to your designated HTTP endpoints. For example, you can now combine IoT messages published from multiple smart home devices in a single batch and route it to a HTTP endpoint in your smart home platform.\n  This new feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS IoT Core is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) and Amazon China Regions.

With this new capability, you can submit a change request for a collaboration, including adding new members, updating member abilities, and modifying collaboration auto-approval settings. To maintain security, all collaboration members must approve change requests before updates take affect, ensuring that existing privacy controls remain protected. For transparency, all change requests are logged in the change history for member review. For example, when a publisher creates a Clean Rooms collaboration with an advertiser, the publisher can add the advertiser’s marketing agency as a new member that can receive the analysis results directly in their account, enabling faster time-to-insights and streamlined campaign optimizations with the publisher. This approach reduces onboarding time while maintaining the existing privacy controls for you and your partners.\n  With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development.

      "description": "Amazon ECS now enables you to define weekly event windows for scheduling task retirements on AWS Fargate. This capability provides precise control over when infrastructure updates and task replacements occur, helping prevent disruption to mission-critical workloads during peak business hours.\n  AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. As part of the AWS shared responsibility model, Fargate maintains the underlying infrastructure with periodic platform updates. Fargate automatically retires your tasks for these updates and notifies you about upcoming task retirements via email and the AWS Health Dashboard. By default, tasks are retired 7 days after notification, but you can configure the fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod account setting to extend the retirement period to 14 days or initiate immediate retirement (0 days). Previously, you could build automation using the task retirement notification and wait period to perform service updates or task replacements on your own cadence. With today's launch, you can now use the Amazon EC2 event windows interface to define weekly event windows for precise control over the timing of Fargate task retirements. For example, you can schedule task retirements for a mission-critical service that requires high uptime during weekdays by configuring retirements to occur only on weekends.\n  To get started, configure the AWS account setting fargateEventWindows to enabled as a one-time set up. Once enabled, configure Amazon EC2 event window(s) by specifying time ranges, and associate the event window(s) with your ECS tasks by selecting Amazon ECS-managed tags as the association target. Use the aws:ecs:clusterArn tag for targeting your tasks in an ECS cluster, aws:ecs:serviceArn tag for ECS services, or aws:ecs:fargateTask with a value of true to apply the window to all Fargate tasks. This feature is now available in all commercial AWS Regions. To learn more, visit our documentation.",

      "description": "Today, EC2 Auto Scaling is launching a new API, LaunchInstances, which gives customers more control and flexibility over how EC2 Auto Scaling provisions instances while providing instant feedback on capacity availability.\n  Customers use EC2 Auto Scaling for automated fleet management. With scaling policies, EC2 Auto Scaling can automatically add instances when demand spikes and remove them when traffic drops, ensuring customers' applications always have the right amount of compute. EC2 Auto Scaling also offers the ability to monitor and replace unhealthy instances. In certain use cases, customers may want to specify exactly where EC2 Auto Scaling should launch additional instances and need immediate feedback on capacity availability. The new LaunchInstances API allows customers to precisely control where instances are launched by specifying an override for any Availability Zone and/or subnet in an Auto Scaling group, while providing immediate feedback on capacity availability. This synchronous operation gives customers real-time insight into scaling operations, enabling them to quickly implement alternative strategies if needed. For additional flexibility, the API includes optional asynchronous retries to help reach the desired capacity.\n  This feature is now available in all AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, at no additional cost beyond standard EC2 and EBS usage.

      "description": "Today, we’re announcing enhanced network policy capabilities in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), allowing customers to improve the network security posture for their Kubernetes workloads and their integrations with cluster-external destinations. This enhancement builds on network segmentation features previously supported in EKS. Now you can centrally enforce network access filters across the entire cluster, as well as leverage Domain Name System (DNS) based policies to secure egress traffic from your cluster’s environment.\n  As customers continue to scale their application environments using EKS, network traffic isolation is increasingly fundamental for preventing unauthorized access to resources inside and outside the cluster. To address this, EKS introduced support for Kubernetes NetworkPolicies in the Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (VPC CNI) plugin, allowing you to segment pod-to-pod communication at a namespace level. Now you can further strengthen the defensive posture for your Kubernetes network environment by centrally managing network filters for the whole cluster. Also, cluster admins now have a more stable and predictable approach for preventing unauthorized access to cluster-external resources in the cloud or on-prem using egress rules that filter traffic to external endpoints based on their Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).\n  These new network security features are available in all commercial AWS Regions for new EKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.29 or later, with support for existing clusters to follow in the coming weeks. ClusterNetworkPolicy is available in all EKS cluster launch modes using VPC CNI v1.21.1 or later. DNS-based policies are only supported in EKS Auto Mode-launched EC2 instances. To learn more, visit the Amazon EKS documentation or read the launch blog post here.",

Previously, ACM automated certificate management for AWS-integrated services like Application Load Balancers and CloudFront. However, using ACM certificates with applications terminating TLS in Kubernetes required manual steps: exporting certificates and private keys via API, creating Kubernetes Secrets, and updating them at renewal. This integration extends ACM's automation to any Kubernetes workload for both public and private certificates, enabling you to manage certificates using native Kubernetes APIs.\n  With ACK, you define certificates as Kubernetes resources, and the ACK controller automates the complete certificate lifecycle: requesting certificates from ACM, exporting them after validation, updating Kubernetes Secrets with the certificate and private key, and automatically updating those Secrets at renewal. This enables you to use ACM exportable public certificates (launched in June 2025) for internet-facing workloads or AWS Private CA private certificates for internal services in Amazon EKS or other Kubernetes environments. Use cases include terminating TLS in application pods (NGINX, custom applications), securing service mesh communication (Istio, Linkerd), and managing certificates for third-party ingress controllers (NGINX Ingress, Traefik). You can also distribute certificates to hybrid and edge Kubernetes environments.\n  This feature is available in all commercial, AWS GovCloud (US), and AWS China regions where ACM is available.\n To learn more, visit the GitHub link or read our documentation and our pricing page.",

      "description": "You can now use Amazon MSK Replicator to replicate streaming data across Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) clusters in ten additional AWS Regions: Middle East (Bahrain), Middle East (UAE), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Africa (Cape Town), Europe (Milan), Europe (Zurich) and Israel (Tel Aviv). \n  MSK Replicator is a feature of Amazon MSK that enables you to reliably replicate data across Amazon MSK clusters in different or the same AWS Region(s) in a few clicks. With MSK Replicator, you can easily build regionally resilient streaming applications for increased availability and business continuity. MSK Replicator provides automatic asynchronous replication across MSK clusters, eliminating the need to write custom code, manage infrastructure, or setup cross-region networking. MSK Replicator automatically scales the underlying resources so that you can replicate data on-demand without having to monitor or scale capacity. MSK Replicator also replicates the necessary Kafka metadata including topic configurations, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and consumer group offsets. If an unexpected event occurs in a region, you can failover to the other AWS Region and seamlessly resume processing.\n  You can get started with MSK Replicator from the Amazon MSK console or the Amazon CLI. With this launch, MSK Replicator is now available in thirty five AWS Regions. To learn more, visit the MSK Replicator documentation, product page, and pricing page.",

      "description": "We are excited to announce that Amazon EMR Managed Scaling is now available for EMR on EC2 customers in the Asia Pacific (Malaysia, Melbourne, New Zealand, Taipei, Thailand), Canada West (Calgary), and Mexico (Central) AWS Regions. Amazon EMR Managed Scaling automatically resizes the EC2 instances in your EMR cluster for the best performance at the lowest possible cost.\n  With Amazon EMR Managed Scaling, you simply specify the minimum and maximum compute limits for your clusters, and Amazon EMR on EC2 automatically resizes your cluster for optimal performance and resource utilization. Amazon EMR Managed Scaling constantly monitors key workload-related metrics and uses an algorithm that optimizes the cluster size for the best resource utilization. Using this algorithm, Amazon EMR can scale the EC2 cluster up during peaks and scale it down during idle periods, reducing your costs and optimizing cluster capacity for the best performance. Amazon EMR Managed Scaling can also be used with Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, that lets you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity for a discount when compared to on-demand prices.\n  Amazon EMR Managed Scaling is now available in all AWS commercial regions.\n  Amazon EMR Managed Scaling is supported for Apache Spark, Apache Hive and YARN-based workloads on Amazon EMR on EC2 versions 6.14 and above.
