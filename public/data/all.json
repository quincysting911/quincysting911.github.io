Consumers can then access the resource using the custom domain, with VPC Lattice managing a private hosted zone in the consumer’s VPC.\n  This feature also provides resource owners and consumers control and flexibility over the domains they want to use. Resource owners can use a custom domain owned by them, or AWS, or a third-party. Consumers can use granular controls to choose which domains they want VPC Lattice to manage private hosted zones for.\n \nThis feature is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where VPC Lattice resource configuration is available.

With AWS PrivateLink, you can establish a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and Amazon Cognito user pools to configure, manage, and authenticate against your Cognito user pools without using the public internet. By enabling private network connectivity, this enhancement eliminates the need to use public IP addresses or relying solely on firewall rules to access Cognito. This feature supports user pool management operations (e.g., list user pools, describe user pools), administrative operations (e.g., admin-created users), and user authentication flows (sign in local users stored in Cognito). OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow (Cognito managed login, hosted UI, sign-in via social identity providers), client credentials flow (Cognito machine-to-machine authorization), and federated sign-ins via SAML and OIDC standards are not supported through VPC endpoints at this time.\n  You can use PrivateLink connections in all AWS Regions where Amazon Cognito user pools is available, except AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Creating VPC endpoints on AWS PrivateLink will incur additional charges; refer to AWS PrivateLink pricing page for details. You can get started by creating an AWS PrivateLink interface endpoint for Amazon Cognito user pools using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or AWS CloudFormation. To learn more, refer to the documentation on creating an interface VPC endpoint and Amazon Cognito’s developer guide.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudFront announces cross-account support for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) origins, enabling customers to access VPC origins that reside in different AWS accounts from their CloudFront distributions. With VPC origins, customers can have their Application Load Balancers (ALB), Network Load Balancers (NLB), and EC2 Instances in a private subnet that is accessible only through their CloudFront distributions. With the support for cross-account VPC origins in CloudFront, customers can now leverage the security benefits of VPC origins while maintaining their existing multi-account architecture.\n  Customers set up multiple AWS accounts for better security isolation, cost management, and compliance. Previously, customers could access origins in private VPCs from CloudFront only if CloudFront and the origin were in the same AWS account. This meant customers who had their origins in multiple AWS accounts, had to keep their accounts in public subnets to get the scale and performance benefits of CloudFront. Customers then had to maintain additional security controls, such as access control lists (ACL), at both the edge and within regions, rather than benefiting from the inherent security of VPC origins. Now, customers can use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to allow CloudFront access to origins in private VPCs in different AWS accounts, both within and outside their AWS Organizations and organizational units (OUs). This streamlines security management and reduces operational complexity, making it easy to use CloudFront as the single front door for applications.\n  VPC origins is available in AWS Commercial Regions only, and the full list of supported AWS Regions is available here. There is no additional cost for using cross-account VPC origins with CloudFront.

With this new release, the warm pool feature now works seamlessly with ASGs configured for multiple On-Demand instance types, whether specified through manual instance type lists or attribute-based instance type selection. The combination of instance type flexibility and warm pools provides a powerful solution that helps customers scale out efficiently while maximizing availability.\n  The warm pool feature is available through the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDKs, and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). It is available in all public AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about warm pools, visit this AWS documentation.",

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale. On-demand streams automatically scale capacity based on data usage, and now you can warm write capacity ad hoc. On-demand Advantage also provides a simpler pricing structure that removes the fixed, per-stream charge, so customers only pay for data usage at better rates.\n  On-demand Advantage offers data usage with 60% lower pricing compared to On-demand Standard, with data ingest at $0.032/GB and data retrieval at $0.016/GB in the US East (N. Virginia) region. The price of Enhanced fan-out data retrieval is the same as shared-throughput retrievals, making higher fan-out use cases more cost effective. The mode also decreases the price of extended retention by 77% from $0.10/GB-month to $0.023/GB-month. Once you enable On-demand Advantage mode, the account will be billed for a minimum of 25MB/s of data ingest and 25MB/s of data retrieval at the lower rates across all on-demand streams. The new pricing means On-demand Advantage is the most cost effective way to stream with Kinesis Data Streams when you ingest at least 10MB/s in aggregate, fan out to more than two consumer applications, or have hundreds of streams in a region. You can check directly in the Kinesis console and the pricing page if On-demand Advantage is a good fit for your account.\n  On-demand Advantage is available in all AWS regions where Kinesis Data Streams is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) and China regions. To learn more, see the launch blog and the Kinesis Data Streams User Guide.",

Starting today we are removing the M2M app client pricing dimension, making it more cost-effective for customers to build and scale their M2M applications. Cognito supports applications that access API data with machine identities. Machine identities in user pools are clients that run on application servers and connect to remote APIs. Their operation happens without user interaction such as scheduled tasks, data streams, or asset updates. This change reduces the pricing of Cognito for customers using M2M authentication by removing the app client price dimension. Customers will continue to be charged based on the number of successful M2M token requests per month.\n  Previously, customers were charged for each M2M app client registered, regardless of usage amount, and each successful token request made by the app client to access a resource. With this change, customers will only pay for their successful token requests, making it more cost-effective to build and scale M2M applications using Amazon Cognito.\n  This pricing change is automatic and requires no action from customers. It is effective in all supported Amazon Cognito regions. To learn more about Amazon Cognito pricing, visit our pricing page.",

These new strategies complement ECS built-in blue/green deployments, enabling you to choose the traffic shifting approach that best matches your application's risk profile and validation requirements.\n \nWith linear deployments, you can gradually shift traffic from your current service revision to the new revision in equal percentage increments over a specified time period. You configure the step percentage (for example, 10%) to control how much traffic shifts at each increment, and set a step bake time to wait between each traffic shift for monitoring and validation. This allows you to validate your new application version at multiple stages with increasing amounts of production traffic. With canary deployments, you can route a small percentage of production traffic to your new service revision while the majority of traffic remains on the current stable version. You set a canary bake time to monitor the new revision's performance, after which Amazon ECS shifts the remaining traffic to the new revision. Both strategies support a deployment bake time that waits after all production traffic has shifted to the new revision before terminating the old revision, enabling quick rollback without downtime if issues are detected. You can configure deployment lifecycle hooks to perform custom validation steps, and use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to automatically detect failures and trigger rollbacks.\n \nThe feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon ECS is available. You can use linear and canary deployment strategies for new and existing Amazon ECS services that use Application Load Balancer (ALB) or ECS Service Connect, using the Console, SDK, CLI, CloudFormation, CDK, and Terraform.

      "description": "AWS announces the general availability of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Capacity Reservation Topology API. It joins the Instance Topology API in enabling customers to efficiently manage capacity, schedule jobs, and rank nodes for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and High-Performance Computing distributed workloads. The Capacity Reservation Topology API gives customers a unique per-account hierarchical view of the relative location of their capacity reservations.\n \nCustomers running distributed parallel workloads are managing thousands of instances across tens to hundreds of capacity reservations. With the Capacity Reservation Topology API, customers can describe the topology of their reservations as a network node set, which will show the relative proximity of their capacity without the need to launch an instance. This enables efficient capacity planning and management as customers provision workloads on tightly coupled capacity. Customers can then use the Instance Topology API, which provides consistent network nodes from the Capacity Reservation Topology API with further granularity, enabling a consistent and seamless way to schedule jobs and rank nodes for optimal performance in distributed parallel workloads.\n \nThe Capacity Reservation Topology API is available in the following AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Spain), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Zurich), Middle East (Bahrain), Middle East (UAE), and South America (São Paulo), and it is supported on all instances available with the Instance Topology API.\n \nTo learn more, please visit the latest EC2 user guide.",

This enhancement lets you seamlessly manage and discover cloud resources—such as Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon DynamoDB tables—across AWS accounts. By sharing your AWS Cloud Map namespace via AWS RAM, workloads in other accounts can discover and manage resources registered in that namespace. This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service discovery across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  You can now share your AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to maintain a centralized service registry—or a small set of registries—and share them across multiple accounts, simplifying service discovery. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. AWS Cloud Map's cross-account service discovery support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale service discovery as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to namespaces.\n  This feature is available now in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation.

With conditional copy, you can now verify if the object exists or has been modified in your destination S3 bucket before copying it. This helps you coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevents multiple concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object.\n  You can now perform conditional copy operations through S3 CopyObject by including either the HTTP if-none-match header to verify object existence or the HTTP if-match header with ETag to validate the object’s content. Additionally, you can use the s3:if-match and s3:if-none-match condition keys in your S3 bucket policies to enforce conditional copy operations. S3 then evaluates the condition against the specified object's key or ETag before executing the copy operation in the destination bucket. This eliminates the need for additional client-side coordination mechanisms or API validation requests.\n  Conditional copy is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions in both S3 general purpose and directory buckets. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to copy data conditionally to your buckets. To learn more about conditional operations, visit the S3 User Guide.",

These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors, available only on AWS, delivering the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud. The R8i and R8i-flex instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver 20% better performance than R7i instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. They are up to 30% faster for PostgreSQL databases, up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, and up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models compared to R7i.\n  R8i-flex, our first memory-optimized Flex instances, are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of memory-intensive workloads. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.\n  R8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. R8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications. R8i instances are SAP-certified and deliver 142,100 aSAPS, the highest among all comparable machines in on-premises and cloud environments, delivering exceptional performance for mission-critical SAP workloads.\n  To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console. Customers can purchase these instances via Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances. For more information about the new R8i and R8i-flex instances visit the AWS News blog.",

      "description": "We are excited to announce the general availability of Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings, a state-of-the-art embedding model for agentic RAG and semantic search. It is the first unified embedding model that supports text, documents, images, video, and audio through a single model, to enable cross-modal retrieval with leading accuracy.\n  Managing and searching across different content types traditionally required multiple specialized embedding models, leading to complexity, higher costs, and data silos. Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings maps diverse content types into a unified space with leading accuracy, helping break down these silos. Developers can build cross-modal applications that search video archives using complex queries, find relevant product images based on customer questions, or search financial documentation that contain both infographics and text explanations, all using a single embedding model.\n  The model supports inputs of up to 8K tokens in length and video/audio segments up to 30 seconds, with the capability to segment larger files. Multiple output embedding dimensions allow organizations to balance accuracy and performance with storage and computation costs. Organizations can choose between synchronous API for near real-time applications and asynchronous API for efficient processing of larger files, enabling them to optimize for both latency-sensitive and high-volume workloads.\n  Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings is available in US East (N. Virginia) in Amazon Bedrock.\n  To learn more, read the AWS News blog and user guide. To get started with Nova Multimodal Embeddings in Amazon Bedrock, visit the Amazon Bedrock console.",

These two metrics, Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check, monitor if the driven IOPS or throughput is exceeding the maximum EBS IOPS or throughput that your instance can support.\n  With these two new metrics at the instance level, you can quickly identify and respond to application performance issues stemming from exceeding the EBS-Optimized limits of your instance. These metrics will return a value of 0 (performance not exceeded) or a 1 (performance exceeded) when your workload is exceeding the EBS-Optimized IOPS or throughput limit of the EC2 instance. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can use these new metrics to create customized dashboards and set alarms that notify you or automatically perform actions based on these metrics, such as moving to a larger instance size or a different instance type that supports higher EBS-Optimized limits.\n  The Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check metrics are available by default at a 1-minute frequency at no additional charges, for all Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instances with EBS volumes attached. You can access these metrics via the EC2 console, CLI, or CloudWatch API in all Commercial AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions.

Customers invoke their Lambda functions asynchronously using either Lambda API directly, or by receiving push-based events from various AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon SNS, Amazon EventBridge, AWS Step Functions.\n  Modern cloud applications increasingly rely on AWS Lambda’s asynchronous invocations and its integration with various AWS serverless services to build scalable, event-driven architectures. These applications often need to process rich contextual data, including large-language model prompts, telemetry signals, and complex JSON structures for machine learning outputs. With increase in maximum payload size to 1MB for asynchronous invocations, developers can streamline their architectures by including comprehensive data, from detailed user profiles to complete transaction histories, in a single event, eliminating the need for complex data chunking or external storage solutions.\n  This feature is generally available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Customers can start sending asynchronous invocation payloads up to 1 MB using Lambda’s invoke API. Customers are charged for 1 request per each asynchronous invocation for first 256 KB. Individual payload size beyond 256 KB is charged 1 additional request for each 64 KB of chunk up to 1 MB. To learn more, read Lambda asynchronous invocation documentation and AWS Lambda pricing.",

Traditional time-based scheduling systems fall short in addressing the dynamic interdependencies between data products, requires event-driven orchestration. Key challenges include coordinating cross-domain dependencies, maintaining data consistency across business units, meeting stringent SLAs, and scaling effectively as data volumes grow. Without a flexible orchestration solution, these issues can lead to delayed business operations and insights, increased operational overhead, and heightened compliance risks due to manual interventions and rigid scheduling mechanisms that cannot adapt to evolving business needs. In this post, we walk through how Stifel Financial Corp, in collaboration with AWS ProServe, has addressed these challenges by building a modular, event-driven orchestration solution using AWS native services that enables precise triggering of data pipelines based on dependency satisfaction, supporting near real-time responsiveness and cross-domain coordination.",
