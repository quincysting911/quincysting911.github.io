You can simply define your task requirements such as the number of vCPUs, memory size, and CPU architecture, and Amazon ECS automatically provisions, configures and operates most optimal EC2 instances within your AWS account using AWS-controlled access. You can also specify desired instance types in Managed Instances Capacity Provider configuration, including GPU-accelerated, network-optimized, and burstable performance, to run your workloads on the instance families you prefer.\n  To get started with ECS Managed Instances, use the AWS Console, Amazon ECS MCP Server, or your favorite infrastructure-as-code tooling to enable it in a new or existing Amazon ECS cluster. You will be charged for the management of compute provisioned, in addition to your regular Amazon EC2 costs. To learn more about ECS Managed Instances, visit the feature page, documentation, and AWS News launch blog.",

      "description": "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser now supports browser profiles, enabling you to reuse authentication state across multiple browser sessions without repeated login flows. This feature reduces session setup time from minutes to tens of seconds for enterprise customers processing hundreds or thousands of automated browser sessions daily.\n \nBrowser profiles persist and reuse browser data including cookies and local storage across multiple sessions. You authenticate to a website once and save the session to a browser profile. When you start a new session using that saved profile, your authentication state is preserved, and you remain logged in. This enables agents to perform tasks on authenticated websites without manual login intervention. You can choose flexible session modes for both read-only and persistent operations, enabling parallel processing where multiple sessions use the same profile simultaneously.\n \nThis feature is available in all 14 AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser is available: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Canada (Central).\n \nTo learn more, visit the Browser Profiles documentation.",

      "description": "AWS Network Firewall has introduced two pricing improvements for customers. The service has added the hourly and data processing discounts on NAT Gateways that are service-chained with Network Firewall secondary endpoints. Additionally, AWS Network Firewall has removed additional data processing charges for Advanced Inspection, which enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection of encrypted network traffic.\n \nPreviously, NAT Gateway discounts were limited to primary Network Firewall endpoints, and customers paid additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection for TLS inspection in select AWS regions. With these improvements, the NAT Gateway discounts now apply when service-chained with both primary and secondary firewall endpoints. Customers also no longer pay the additional data processing charge for Advanced Inspection that ranged from $0.001/GB to $0.009/GB in 13 AWS regions: Middle East (Bahrain), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), EU (Milan), South America (São Paulo), US West (N. California), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Melbourne).\n \nThese changes help to reduce costs for architectures that use Network Firewall's multiple VPC endpoint capability and TLS inspection features. Multiple VPC endpoints allow you to connect 50 VPCs per Availability Zone to a single Network Firewall, helping to reduce operational complexity and lower costs as you protect more VPCs. By removing additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection, customers can now implement TLS inspection more cost-effectively across their network security architecture.\n \nThese pricing improvements are available in all AWS regions where Network Firewall is offered and are applied automatically to eligible configurations. No action is required from customers.\n \nTo learn more, see AWS Network Firewall pricing and the AWS Network Firewall service documentation.",

Customers can now create custom connectors to any REST-enabled data source and seamlessly integrate that data into their AWS Glue ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) jobs. This capability extends AWS Glue's existing connectivity to 100+ non-AWS data sources through 60+ native connectors and additional options on AWS Marketplace.\n  Previously, connecting to proprietary systems or emerging platforms required customers to build custom connectors by providing specialized JARs with the necessary libraries. The new native REST API connector eliminates this complexity, making it easier to integrate data from any REST-enabled source.

      "description": "Amazon CloudFront announces support for mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for origins, a security protocol that enables customers to verify that requests to their origin servers come only from their authorized CloudFront distributions using TLS certificates. This certificate-based authentication provides cryptographic verification of CloudFront's identity, eliminating the need for customers to manage custom security controls.\n  Previously, verifying that requests came from CloudFront distributions required customers to build and maintain custom authentication solutions like shared secret headers or IP allow-lists, particularly for public or externally hosted origins. These approaches required ongoing operational overhead to rotate secrets, update allow-lists, and maintain custom code. Now with origin mTLS support, customers can implement a standardized, certificate-based authentication approach that eliminates this operational burden. This enables organizations to enforce strict authentication for their proprietary content, ensuring that only verified CloudFront distributions can establish connections to backend infrastructure ranging from AWS origins and on-premises servers to third-party cloud providers and external CDNs. Customers can leverage client certificates issued by AWS Private Certificate Authority or third-party private Certificate Authorities, which they import through AWS Certificate Manager.\n  Customers can configure origin mTLS using the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDK, CDK, or CloudFormation. Origin mTLS is supported for all origins that support mutual TLS on AWS such as Application Load Balancer and API Gateway, as well as on-premises and custom origins. There is no additional charge for origin mTLS. Origin mTLS is also available in the Business and Premium flat-rate pricing plans.

This capability allows customers to quickly diagnose setup issues and take timely corrective actions to operate resilient data streaming workloads. This capability is available for both Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) and self-managed Apache Kafka (SMK) event source mappings.\n  Customers use Kafka event source mappings (ESM) with their Lambda functions to build mission-critical applications. However, the lack of visibility into event polling setup, scaling, and processing state for events slows down troubleshooting for issues resulting from faulty permissions, misconfiguration, or function errors, which increases mean time to resolution and adds operational overhead. With this launch, customers can enable CloudWatch Logs and metrics to monitor their Kafka polling setup, scaling, and event processing state. Customers can select from multiple log level options that provide logs ranging from warnings and errors to detailed information about event processing progress. Similarly, customers can enable one or more metrics groups—EventCount, ErrorCount, and KafkaMetrics—to monitor various aspects of event processing. Customers can view all their metrics and logs via a dedicated monitoring page on AWS Console for ESM. This capability allows customers to utilize their observability tooling to quickly diagnose setup issues and track performance metrics to meet their stringent business requirements.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Commercial Regions where AWS Lambda's Provisioned mode for Kafka ESM is available.\n  You can enable ESM logs and metrics for your Kafka ESM using AWS Lambda's Create and Update ESM APIs, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM.

With additional storage volumes, customers can add up to three storage volumes, each with up to 64 TiB, in addition to the primary storage volume for their database instance. As a result, customers get flexibility to add or remove storage with evolving workload demands, without incurring application downtime, and set up their database instance with up to 256 TiB storage. Now, with support for cross-Region replicas, customers that set up database instances with cross-Region replicas for business-critical applications also get the benefit of using additional storage volumes for storage flexibility.\n  When you create a cross-Region replica for a database instance that is set up with additional storage volumes, Amazon RDS for Oracle automatically configures the same storage layout on the replica. Subsequently, you can apply changes to additional storage volumes on the primary instance and the replica using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a cross-Region replica to serve as the new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica to meet low recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for business critical applications.\n  You will need an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license to use replicas in mounted mode, and an additional Oracle Active Data Guard license to use replicas in read-only mode. We recommend consulting your legal team or licensing expert to verify Oracle license requirements for your specific use case. Amazon RDS for Oracle cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes is available in all AWS Regions including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

      "description": "Amazon Cognito introduces inbound federation Lambda triggers that enable you to transform and customize federated user attributes during the authentication process. You can now modify responses from external SAML and OIDC providers before they are stored in your user pool, providing complete programmatic control over the federation flow without requiring changes to your identity provider configuration..\n \nInbound federation Lambda trigger addresses current limitations in federated authentication workflows, particularly issues caused by attribute size limits and the need for selective attribute storage from external identity providers. For example, large group attributes from external SAML or OIDC identity providers that exceed Cognito’s 2,048 character limit per attribute can block the authentication flow. This capability allows you to add, override, or suppress attribute values, such as modifying large group attributes, before creating new federated users or updating existing federated user profiles in Cognito.\n \nThe new inbound federation Lambda trigger is available through hosted UI (classic) and managed login in all AWS Regions where Amazon Cognito is available. To get started, configure the trigger using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or AWS CloudFormation by adding the new parameter to your User Pool LambdaConfig. To learn more, see the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide for implementation examples and best practices.",

Amazon Keyspaces is serverless, so you pay for only the resources that you use and you can build applications that serve thousands of requests per second with virtually unlimited throughput and storage.\n  While Amazon Keyspaces automatically scales to accommodate growing workloads, certain scenarios like application launches, marketing campaigns, or seasonal events can create sudden traffic spikes that exceed normal scaling patterns. With pre-warming, you can now manually specify your expected peak throughput requirements during table creation or update operations, ensuring your tables are immediately ready to handle large traffic surges without scaling delays or increased error rates.\n  The pre-warming process is non-disruptive and runs asynchronously, allowing you to continue making other table modifications while pre-warming is in progress.

SOPs are structured, natural language instructions that guide AI agents through complex, multi-step tasks to ensure consistent, reliable, and efficient behavior. With these automated procedures, customers can deploy web applications to their AWS account using natural language prompts from any MCP-compatible IDE or CLI, including Kiro, Kiro CLI, Cursor, and Claude Code. Deployment works by generating AWS CDK infrastructure, deploying CloudFormation stacks, and creating CI/CD pipelines with recommended AWS security best practices.\n  Previously, developers struggled to take their vibe-coded applications to production with DevOps best practices in place. Now, developers can move quickly from prototype to production in as little as one prompt. When you ask your AI assistant configured with AWS MCP Server to deploy your web application, your AI agent will follow the multi-step plan defined in Agent SOPs to analyze the project structure, generate CDK infrastructure, and deploy a preview environment hosted on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. Once you are ready, it can configure AWS CodePipeline for automated production deployments from source repositories, setting up CI/CD automatically for your application. The Agent SOPs support web applications built with popular frameworks including React, Vue.js, Angular, and Next.js. Deployment documentation is automatically created in the repository, enabling agents to handle future deployments, query logs for troubleshooting and resume work across sessions.\n  The Agent SOPs are available in preview as part of the AWS MCP Server at no additional cost in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You pay only for AWS resources you create and applicable data transfer costs. To get started, see the AWS MCP Server documentation.",

With automatic scaling to and from zero instances, game developers using Amazon GameLift Servers can optimize their multiplayer gaming infrastructure costs while maintaining responsive performance.\n  By eliminating charges for unused instances during inactive periods, while automatically scaling up when game sessions are requested, this new capability delivers significant cost savings for game developers. This is particularly valuable for games with distinct peak and off-peak periods, seasonal or event-based games, new game launches with uncertain traffic patterns, and regional games with time-zone specific activity. Additionally, scaling decisions no longer need manual intervention, as Amazon GameLift Servers intelligently adapts to natural gaming activity patterns.\n  The automatic scaling to zero instances capability is available in all Amazon GameLift Servers supported regions.

With this feature, customers can now use printer-specific capabilities such as double-sided printing, paper tray selection, finishing options (stapling, hole-punching), and color management directly from their Windows WorkSpaces.\n \nAdvanced printer redirection addresses the need for specialized printing features that require printer-specific drivers rather than generic drivers. This capability is ideal for organizations with users who need advanced printing features for professional documents, labels, or specialized output. The feature includes configurable driver validation modes (exact match, partial match, or name-only matching) to balance compatibility with feature support, allowing administrators to optimize for their specific environment. When matching drivers are not found, WorkSpaces automatically falls back to basic printing mode, ensuring users can always print.\n \nThis feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon WorkSpaces Personal is offered. Advanced printer redirection is supported on Windows WorkSpaces with Windows clients only, and requires WorkSpaces Agent version 2.2.0.2116 or later and Windows client version 5.31 or later. Matching printer drivers must be installed on both the WorkSpace and the client device.\n \nFor more information about advanced printer redirection in Amazon WorkSpaces, see Configure Printer Support for DCV in the Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide, or visit the Amazon WorkSpaces page to learn more about virtual desktop solutions from AWS.",

This condition key is used with the DeleteAutoScalingGroup action to control whether the ForceDelete parameter can be used during deletion, which determines if an Auto Scaling group (ASG) can be deleted while it still contains running instances. You can use this condition key in IAM policies to restrict deletion permissions. This provides a safety measure to prevent accidental deletion of ASGs that still have running instances.\n  Furthermore, EC2 Auto Scaling now offers deletion protection at the group level. The new deletion-protection configuration can be set either when you create your ASGs or update them. This new feature lets you set enhanced controls based on your workload's criticality, with multiple protection levels available to safeguard against accidental deletions and help maintain application availability.\n  Combining the autoscaling:ForceDelete condition key with deletion protection at the group level provides a layered defense against unwanted ASG termination by allowing you to both restrict IAM permissions for force-delete operations and set enhanced protection controls directly on critical ASGs.\n  The features now available in all AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To get started, visit the EC2 Auto Scaling console or refer to our technical documentation for deletion protection and policy condition keys for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now provides enhanced troubleshooting capabilities for lifecycle scripts, making it easier to identify and resolve issues during cluster node provisioning. SageMaker HyperPod helps you provision resilient clusters for running AI/ML workloads and developing state-of-the-art models such as large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and foundation models (FMs).\n  When lifecycle scripts encounter issues during cluster creation or node operations, you now receive detailed error messages that include the specific CloudWatch log group and log stream names where you can find execution logs for lifecycle scripts. You can view these error messages by running the DescribeCluster API or by viewing the cluster details page in the SageMaker console. The console also provides a \"View lifecycle script logs\" button that navigates directly to the relevant CloudWatch log stream, making it easier to locate logs. Additionally, CloudWatch logs for lifecycle scripts now include specific markers to help you track lifecycle script execution progress, including indicators for when the lifecycle script log begins, when scripts are being downloaded, when downloads complete, and when scripts succeed or fail. These markers help you quickly identify where issues occurred during the provisioning process. These enhancements reduce the time required to diagnose and fix lifecycle script failures, helping you get your HyperPod clusters up and running faster.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is supported. To learn more, see SageMaker HyperPod cluster management in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.",

This launch enables you to apply SQL hints to your queries using comment-style syntax in pre-approved analysis templates as well as ad hoc SQL queries. You can now optimize large table joins using a broadcast join hint and you can improve data distribution with partition hints for better parallel processing. For example, a measurement company analyzing how many households viewed a live sports event uses a broadcast join hint on their lookup table to improve query performance and reduce costs.\n  With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development. For more information about the AWS Regions where AWS Clean Rooms is available, see the AWS Regions table. To learn more about collaborating with AWS Clean Rooms, visit AWS Clean Rooms.",
