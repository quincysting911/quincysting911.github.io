Each contact also records when ringing began and ended for precise reporting and traceability.\n  When ring duration is static, businesses struggle to balance calling efficiency and customer reach. Calls that ring too briefly may miss customers who take longer to answer, while excessive ring times delay overall campaign pacing. This lack of control leads to inconsistent contact rates and reduced agent productivity.\n  With configurable ring time, campaign managers can tune dialing behavior to their audience for each campaign, use analytics to see exactly how long each call rang, and understand where connections were missed. This visibility helps identify patterns, refine calling strategies, and continuously improve campaign effectiveness.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage. This feature is available in AWS regions, including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London).\n  To learn more about configuring ring time for campaigns, visit our webpage.",

With this new capability, you can centrally configure and manage scan types—such as Amazon EC2 scanning, ECR scanning, Lambda standard and Code Scanning, and Code Security — across all the accounts in your organization, selected organizational units (OUs), or individual accounts. The new Inspector policy type within AWS Organization simplifies your service onboarding, management, and ensures consistent, organization-wide vulnerability scanning coverage.\n  This feature helps you maintain a uniform security baseline by automating Inspector enablement through a single AWS Organization policy. To get started, designate a delegated admin within Amazon Inspector, enable the “Inspector policies” policy type in the AWS Organizations console, and create a policy that specifies the desired scan types and Regions. Once attached to your organization root or OUs, Inspector will automatically be enabled for all the specified scan-types across covered accounts . When the Inspector policy is created and attached, all in-scope accounts automatically are aligned with your Organization-wide policy definition. New accounts that join the organization or are moved into an OU with an attached policy, inherit Inspector enablement automatically—reducing operational overhead and eliminating coverage gaps.\n  Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans AWS workloads including Amazon EC2 instances, container images, AWS Lambda functions, and code repositories for software vulnerabilities, code vulnerabilities, and unintended network exposure across your entire AWS organization. The AWS Organizations Inspector policy for organization-wide enablement is available at no additional cost to Amazon Inspector customers in all AWS commercial, China, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where Amazon Inspector is available.\n  To learn more about Amazon Inspector policies within AWS Organization, visit:\n  \n \n \nGetting started with Amazon Inspector\n \n \nManaging organization policies with AWS Organizations",

This capability allows customers to define how Reserved Instances and Savings Plans benefits are distributed among specific groups of accounts within their AWS organization, ensuring cost savings align with their business structure and accountability requirements.\n  RISP Group Sharing addresses a common challenge faced by enterprise customers managing AWS costs across multiple business units: for example, Reserved Instances and Savings Plans don't always benefit the teams that purchased them. With this feature, customers can create groups using AWS Cost Categories that reflect their organizational hierarchy—whether by business units, projects, geographical regions, or funding sources. The feature offers two sharing options: the Prioritized Group Sharing applies commitments to defined groups first, then shares unused capacity organization-wide, while the Restricted Group Sharing keeps commitments exclusively within defined groups for complete isolation when strict boundaries are required.\n  RISP Group Sharing is available now in all AWS Regions, except AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and the China Regions.\n  To get started with RISP Group Sharing, visit the Billing preferences from the AWS Billing and Cost Management Console and follow the guided setup to create your first Cost Category and configure sharing preferences.

      "description": "Amazon ECS Managed Instances (ECS Managed Instances) now gives you greater control over infrastructure optimization with configurable scale-in delay. This enhancement allows you to fine-tune instance management based on your specific workload patterns and business requirements, helping you better balance cost optimization with operational needs.\n  ECS Managed Instances is a fully managed compute option that automatically provisions right-sized Amazon EC2 instances based on your workload requirements. Over time, your compute resources may drift from workload requirements due to changing traffic patterns or dynamic scaling. ECS Managed Instances continuously monitors and proactively optimizes costs by terminating idle Amazon EC2 instances not running any tasks, and consolidating tasks from underutilized instances onto other, right-sized instances, provisioning new instances if required. ECS uses a heuristic based delay for scaling-in your instances to deliver a balance of high availability and cost optimization. However, your workloads or business may have unique requirements. For example, you might need to retain instances for a longer time period to accommodate incoming batch jobs and minimize instance churn. Starting today, you can set the scaleInAfter configuration parameter to up to 60 minutes to align with your specific infrastructure optimization needs. You can also set the scaleInAfter to -1 to disable infrastructure optimization workflows, which will allow your instances to run until they are patched after 14 days.\n  You can use ECS API, console, SDK, CDK, CloudFormation to configure scaleInAfter parameter when creating or updating an ECS Managed Instances capacity provider. This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions. To learn more, review documentation and deep dive blog post.",

For example, if you track 500 application teams using a 'team' cost allocation tag, you previously needed to create and maintain 500 individual monitors. Now, you can create a single managed monitor that automatically tracks each team's spending separately. When your organization evolves—such as 'team-mobile' splitting into 'team-ios' and 'team-android'—both new teams are automatically monitored individually without any configuration changes, ensuring continuous anomaly detection as your organization grows.\n  The extension of AWS managed monitors to linked accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories is available today in all commercial AWS Regions at no additional charge.\n  To learn more, visit AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, or read our blog post.

With this feature, security, compliance, and operations teams can efficiently monitor high-volume data access patterns without processing massive numbers of individual events.\n  Aggregation for data events streamlines security monitoring by consolidating high-volume AWS API activity into 5-minute summaries. These summaries highlight key trends like access frequency, error rates, and most-used actions, allowing teams to quickly identify patterns while maintaining access to detailed events when needed. Security teams can easily answer questions like \"How has this user's activity changed over the past week?\" or \"What are the top actions being performed on this critical resource?\" without having to scan through voluminous CloudTrail data events.\n  You can enable aggregation in your trails capturing data events through the AWS console or CLI, and choose from pre-built aggregation templates for API activity, resource access, and user activity summaries. For more information, see the CloudTrail trail documentation. You are charged for aggregations based on the number of CloudTrail data events that are analyzed to create the aggregation. For more information, visit the CloudTrail pricing page.\n  You can use CloudTrail aggregations for data in all commercial AWS Regions.",

The new Flex tier offers cost-effective pricing for non-time-critical applications like model evaluations and content summarization while the Priority tier provides premium performance and preferential processing for mission-critical applications. For most models that support Priority Tier, customers can realize up to 25% better output tokens per second (OTPS) latency compared to standard tier. These join the existing Standard tier for everyday AI applications with reliable performance.\n \nThese service tiers address key challenges that organizations face when deploying AI at scale. The Flex tier is designed for non-interactive workloads that can tolerate longer latencies, making it ideal for model evaluations, content summarization, labeling and annotation, and multistep agentic workflow, and it’s priced at a discount relative to the Standard tier. During periods of high demand, Flex requests receive lower priority relative to the Standard tier. The Priority tier is an ideal fit for mission critical applications, real-time end-user interactions, and interactive experiences where consistent, fast responses are essential. During periods of high demand, Priority requests receive processing priority, at a premium price, over other service tiers. These new service tiers are available today for a range of leading foundation models, including OpenAI (gpt-oss-20b, gpt-oss-120b), DeepSeek (DeepSeek V3.1), Qwen3 (Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct, Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct, 32B dense, Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507), and Amazon Nova (Nova Pro and Nova Premier). With these new options, Amazon Bedrock helps customers gain greater control over balancing cost efficiency with performance requirements, enabling them to scale AI workloads economically while ensuring optimal user experiences for their most critical applications.\n \nFor more information about the AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Priority and Flex inference service tiers are available, see the AWS Regions table\n \nLearn more about service tiers in our News Blog and documentation.",

EC2 Auto Scaling also offers the ability to monitor and replace unhealthy instances. In certain use cases, customers may want to specify exactly where EC2 Auto Scaling should launch additional instances and need immediate feedback on capacity availability. The new LaunchInstances API allows customers to precisely control where instances are launched by specifying an override for any Availability Zone and/or subnet in an Auto Scaling group, while providing immediate feedback on capacity availability. This synchronous operation gives customers real-time insight into scaling operations, enabling them to quickly implement alternative strategies if needed. For additional flexibility, the API includes optional asynchronous retries to help reach the desired capacity.\n  This feature is now available in US East (N.

R8gd and M8gd database instances offer improved price-performance. For example, Optimized Reads on R8gd instances deliver up to 165% better throughput and up to 120% better price-performance over R6g instances for Aurora PostgreSQL.\n  Optimized Reads uses local NVMe-based SSD block storage available on these instances to store ephemeral data, such as temporary tables, reducing data access to/from network-based storage and improving read latency and throughput. The result is improved query performance for complex queries and faster index rebuild operations. Aurora PostgreSQL Optimized Reads instances using the I/O-Optimized configuration additionally use the local storage to extend their caching capacity. Database pages that are evicted from the in-memory buffer cache are cached in local storage to speed subsequent retrieval of that data.\n  Customers can get started with Optimized Reads through the AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDK by modifying their existing Aurora and RDS databases or creating a new database using R8gd or M8gd instances.

      "description": "Amazon Redshift today announces the general availability of Just-In-Time (JIT) ANALYZE capability for Apache Iceberg tables, enabling users to run high performance read and write analytics queries on Apache Iceberg tables within the Redshift data lake. The Apache Iceberg open table format has been used by many customers to simplify data processing on rapidly expanding and evolving tables stored in data lakes.\n  Unlike traditional data warehouses, data lakes often lack comprehensive table-level and column-level statistics about the underlying data, making it challenging for query engines to choose the most optimal query execution plans without visibility into the table and column statistics. Sub-optimal query execution plans can lead to slower and less predictable performance.\n  ‘JIT ANALYZE’ is a new Amazon Redshift feature that automatically collects and utilizes statistics for Iceberg tables during query execution, eliminating manual statistics collection while giving the query engine the information it needs to generate optimal query execution plans. The system uses intelligent heuristics to identify queries that will benefit from statistics, maintains lightweight sketch data structures, and builds high quality table-level and column-level statistics. JIT ANALYZE delivers out-of-the-box performance on par with queries that have pre-calculated statistics, while providing the foundation for many other performance optimizations.\n  The Amazon Redshift JIT ANALYZE feature for Apache Iceberg tables is now available in all AWS regions where Amazon Redshift is available. Users do not need to make any changes or enable any settings to take advantage of this new data lake query optimization.

Amazon Linux serves as the foundation for countless applications running on AWS, but developers often face lengthy processes when building packages from source code. SPAL addresses this challenge by offering ready-to-use packages that accelerate development workflows for teams working with AL2023 environments.\n  With SPAL, development teams can significantly reduce deployment times and focus on core application development rather than package compilation. This solution is particularly valuable for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need reliable packages for production workloads without the overhead of building from source. SPAL packages are derived from the community-maintained EPEL9 project, with AWS providing security patches as they become available upstream. AWS will continue expanding the repository based on customer feedback through the Amazon Linux 2023 GitHub repository.\n  Supplementary Packages for Amazon Linux (SPAL) is available in all AWS Commercial Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China.\n  To get started, review available packages in the SPAL repository and update your package management configuration to include the SPAL repository for Amazon Linux 2023.

Change set creation now provides early feedback on common deployment errors. Stack events are now grouped by an operation ID with access through the new describe-operation API to accelerate analysis of deployment errors. This empowers developers to reduce deployment cycle times and cut troubleshooting time from minutes to seconds.\n  When you create a change set, CloudFormation now validates your template against three common failure causes: invalid property syntax, resource name conflict with existing resources in your account, and S3 bucket emptiness constraint on delete operations. If validation fails, the change set status shows ‘FAILED’ with a detailed status on the validation failure. You can then view details for each failure, including the property path associated with them, to pinpoint exactly where issues occur in your template. When you execute a validated change set, the deployment can still fail because of resource-specific runtime errors, such as resource limits or service-specific constraints. For troubleshooting runtime errors, every stack operation now receives a unique ID. You can zoom into the stack events for an operation and filter down to the events that caused the deployment to fail. This allows you to quickly identify root causes, reducing your troubleshooting time.\n  Get started by creating change sets through the CloudFormation Console, CLI, or SDK.

Configuration drift occurs when infrastructure managed by IaC is modified via the AWS Management Console, SDK, or CLI. With drift-aware change sets, you can revert drift and keep infrastructure in sync with templates. Additionally, you can preview the impact of deployments on drifted resources and prevent unexpected changes.\n  Customers can modify infrastructure outside of IaC when troubleshooting operational incidents. This creates the risk of unexpected changes in future IaC deployments, impacts the security posture of infrastructure, and hampers reproducibility for testing and disaster recovery. Standard change sets can compare a template with your last-deployed template, but do not consider drift. Drift-aware change sets provide a three-way diff between a new template, last-deployed template, and actual infrastructure state. If your diff predicts unintended overwrites of drift, you can update your template values and recreate the change set. During change set execution, CloudFormation will match resource properties with template values and recreate resources deleted outside of IaC. If a provisioning error occurs, CloudFormation will restore infrastructure to its actual state before deployment.\n  To get started, create a change set for an existing stack from the CloudFormation Console and choose “Drift-aware” as the change set type. Alternatively, pass the --deployment-mode REVERT_DRIFT parameter to the CreateChangeSet API from the AWS CLI or SDK. To learn more, visit the CloudFormation User Guide.\n  Drift-aware change sets are available in AWS Regions where CloudFormation is available. Refer to the AWS Region table to learn more.",

Data lake use cases continue to evolve and become increasingly sophisticated, and require capabilities like transactional consistency for record-level updates and deletes while having seamless schema and partition evolution support. With this milestone Amazon Redshift now supports SQL DDL (data definition language) operations to CREATE an Apache Iceberg table, SHOW the table definition SQL, DROP the table and perform DML (data manipulation language) operations such as INSERT. You can continue to use Amazon Redshift to read from your Apache Iceberg tables in AWS Glue Data Catalog and perform write operations on those Apache Iceberg tables while other users or applications can safely run DML operations on your tables.\n  Apache Iceberg support in Amazon Redshift is available in all AWS regions where Amazon Redshift is available. To get started, visit the documentation page for Amazon Redshift Management Guide.",

      "description": "Starting today, Amazon Aurora MySQL - Compatible Edition 3 (with MySQL 8.0 compatibility) will support MySQL 8.0.43 through Aurora MySQL v3.11.\n  In addition to several security enhancements and bug fixes, MySQL 8.0.43 contains additional errors for group replication and introduces the mysql client “commands” option, which enables or disables most mysql client commands. For more details, refer to the Aurora MySQL 3.11 and MySQL 8.0.43 release notes. To upgrade to Aurora MySQL 3.11, you can initiate a minor version upgrade manually by modifying your DB cluster, or you can enable the “Auto minor version upgrade” option when creating or modifying a DB cluster. This release is available in all AWS regions where Aurora MySQL is available.\n  Amazon Aurora is designed for unparalleled high performance and availability at global scale with full MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility. It provides built-in security, continuous backups, serverless compute, up to 15 read replicas, automated multi-Region replication, and integrations with other Amazon Web Services services. To get started with Amazon Aurora, take a look at our getting started page.",

      "description": "Today, AWS launched the ability for Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) to automatically acquire non-overlapping IP address allocations from Infoblox Universal IPAM. This feature minimizes manual processes between cloud and on-premises administrators, reducing the turnaround time.\n  With this launch, you can automatically acquire non-overlapping IP addresses from your on-premises Infoblox Universal IPAM into your top-level AWS IPAM pool and organize them into regional pools based on your business requirements. When you acquire non-overlapping IPs, you reduce the risk of service disruptions because your IPs don’t conflict with on-premise IP addresses. Previously, in hybrid cloud environments, administrators had to use offline means such as tickets or emails to request and allocate IP addresses, which was often error-prone and time-consuming. This integration automates the manual process, improving operational efficiency.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon VPC IPAM is supported, excluding AWS China Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.\n  To learn more about IPAM, view the IPAM documentation. For details on pricing, refer to the IPAM tab on the Amazon VPC Pricing Page.",

      "description": "Stifel Financial Corp, a diversified financial services holding company is expanding its data landscape that requires an orchestration solution capable of managing increasingly complex data pipeline operations across multiple business domains. Traditional time-based scheduling systems fall short in addressing the dynamic interdependencies between data products, requires event-driven orchestration. Key challenges include coordinating cross-domain dependencies, maintaining data consistency across business units, meeting stringent SLAs, and scaling effectively as data volumes grow. Without a flexible orchestration solution, these issues can lead to delayed business operations and insights, increased operational overhead, and heightened compliance risks due to manual interventions and rigid scheduling mechanisms that cannot adapt to evolving business needs. In this post, we walk through how Stifel Financial Corp, in collaboration with AWS ProServe, has addressed these challenges by building a modular, event-driven orchestration solution using AWS native services that enables precise triggering of data pipelines based on dependency satisfaction, supporting near real-time responsiveness and cross-domain coordination.",

Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
