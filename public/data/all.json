      "description": "Amazon S3 expands conditional write functionality to copy operations. With conditional copy, you can now verify if the object exists or has been modified in your destination S3 bucket before copying it. This helps you coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevents multiple concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object.\n  You can now perform conditional copy operations through S3 CopyObject by including either the HTTP if-none-match header to verify object existence or the HTTP if-match header with ETag to validate the object’s content. Additionally, you can use the s3:if-match and s3:if-none-match condition keys in your S3 bucket policies to enforce conditional copy operations. S3 then evaluates the condition against the specified object's key or ETag before executing the copy operation in the destination bucket. This eliminates the need for additional client-side coordination mechanisms or API validation requests.\n  Conditional copy is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions in both S3 general purpose and directory buckets. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to copy data conditionally to your buckets. To learn more about conditional operations, visit the S3 User Guide.",

These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors, available only on AWS, delivering the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud. The R8i and R8i-flex instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver 20% better performance than R7i instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. They are up to 30% faster for PostgreSQL databases, up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, and up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models compared to R7i.\n  R8i-flex, our first memory-optimized Flex instances, are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of memory-intensive workloads. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.\n  R8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. R8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications. R8i instances are SAP-certified and deliver 142,100 aSAPS, the highest among all comparable machines in on-premises and cloud environments, delivering exceptional performance for mission-critical SAP workloads.\n  To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console.

      "description": "We are excited to announce the general availability of Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings, a state-of-the-art embedding model for agentic RAG and semantic search. It is the first unified embedding model that supports text, documents, images, video, and audio through a single model, to enable cross-modal retrieval with leading accuracy.\n  Managing and searching across different content types traditionally required multiple specialized embedding models, leading to complexity, higher costs, and data silos. Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings maps diverse content types into a unified space with leading accuracy, helping break down these silos. Developers can build cross-modal applications that search video archives using complex queries, find relevant product images based on customer questions, or search financial documentation that contain both infographics and text explanations, all using a single embedding model.\n  The model supports inputs of up to 8K tokens in length and video/audio segments up to 30 seconds, with the capability to segment larger files. Multiple output embedding dimensions allow organizations to balance accuracy and performance with storage and computation costs. Organizations can choose between synchronous API for near real-time applications and asynchronous API for efficient processing of larger files, enabling them to optimize for both latency-sensitive and high-volume workloads.\n  Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings is available in US East (N. Virginia) in Amazon Bedrock.\n  To learn more, read the AWS News blog and user guide. To get started with Nova Multimodal Embeddings in Amazon Bedrock, visit the Amazon Bedrock console.",

To see the list of all supported AWS public regions and AWS GovCloud (US) regions, click here.\n  Predictive Scaling is appropriate for applications that experience recurring patterns of steep demand changes, such as early morning spikes when business resumes. It learns from the past patterns and launches instances in advance of predicted demand, giving instances time to warm up. Predictive scaling enhances existing Auto Scaling policies, such as Target Tracking or Simple Scaling, so that your applications scale based on both real-time metrics and historic patterns. You can preview how Predictive Scaling works with your ASG by using the “Forecast Only” mode.\n  Predictive Scaling is available as a scaling policy type through AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), EC2 Auto Scaling Management Console, AWS CloudFormation and AWS SDKs. To learn more, visit the Predictive Scaling page in the EC2 Auto Scaling documentation.",

These two metrics, Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check, monitor if the driven IOPS or throughput is exceeding the maximum EBS IOPS or throughput that your instance can support.\n  With these two new metrics at the instance level, you can quickly identify and respond to application performance issues stemming from exceeding the EBS-Optimized limits of your instance. These metrics will return a value of 0 (performance not exceeded) or a 1 (performance exceeded) when your workload is exceeding the EBS-Optimized IOPS or throughput limit of the EC2 instance. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can use these new metrics to create customized dashboards and set alarms that notify you or automatically perform actions based on these metrics, such as moving to a larger instance size or a different instance type that supports higher EBS-Optimized limits.\n  The Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check metrics are available by default at a 1-minute frequency at no additional charges, for all Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instances with EBS volumes attached. You can access these metrics via the EC2 console, CLI, or CloudWatch API in all Commercial AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions.

Customers invoke their Lambda functions asynchronously using either Lambda API directly, or by receiving push-based events from various AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon SNS, Amazon EventBridge, AWS Step Functions.\n  Modern cloud applications increasingly rely on AWS Lambda’s asynchronous invocations and its integration with various AWS serverless services to build scalable, event-driven architectures. These applications often need to process rich contextual data, including large-language model prompts, telemetry signals, and complex JSON structures for machine learning outputs. With increase in maximum payload size to 1MB for asynchronous invocations, developers can streamline their architectures by including comprehensive data, from detailed user profiles to complete transaction histories, in a single event, eliminating the need for complex data chunking or external storage solutions.\n  This feature is generally available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Customers can start sending asynchronous invocation payloads up to 1 MB using Lambda’s invoke API. Customers are charged for 1 request per each asynchronous invocation for first 256 KB.

Agents can see key customer information—such as name, account balance, and prior interactions—and choose the right moment to call. Campaign managers can tailor preview settings and monitor performance through new dashboards that bring visibility to agent behavior, campaign outcomes, and customer engagement trends.\n  Without proper context, agents struggle to personalize interactions, leading to low customer engagement and poor experiences. Additionally, businesses can face steep regulatory penalties under laws such as the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) or the UK Office of Communications (OFCOM) for delays in customer-agent connection.\n  With preview dialing, campaign managers can define review time limits and optionally enable contact removal from campaigns. During preview, agents see a countdown timer alongside customer data and can initiate calls at any moment. Analytics reveal performance patterns—such as average preview time or discard volume—giving managers data to optimize strategy and coach teams effectively. By reserving an agent prior to placing the call, companies can support compliance with regulations while bringing precision to outbound calling, improving both customer connection and operational control.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage. Preview dialing is available in AWS regions, including US East (N.

Traditional time-based scheduling systems fall short in addressing the dynamic interdependencies between data products, requires event-driven orchestration. Key challenges include coordinating cross-domain dependencies, maintaining data consistency across business units, meeting stringent SLAs, and scaling effectively as data volumes grow. Without a flexible orchestration solution, these issues can lead to delayed business operations and insights, increased operational overhead, and heightened compliance risks due to manual interventions and rigid scheduling mechanisms that cannot adapt to evolving business needs. In this post, we walk through how Stifel Financial Corp, in collaboration with AWS ProServe, has addressed these challenges by building a modular, event-driven orchestration solution using AWS native services that enables precise triggering of data pipelines based on dependency satisfaction, supporting near real-time responsiveness and cross-domain coordination.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) added visibility into the IP addresses used by Dedicated IP Addresses - Managed (DIP-M) pools. Customers can now find out the exact addresses in use when sending emails through DIP-M pools to mailbox providers. Customers can also see Microsoft Smart Network Data Services (SNDS) metrics for these IP addresses, giving them more insight into their sending reputation with Microsoft mailbox providers. This gives customers more transparency into the IP activities in DIP-M pools.\n  Previously, customers could configure DIP-M pools to perform automatic IP allocation and warm-up in response to changes in email sending volumes. This reduced the operational overhead of managing dedicated sending channels, but customers could not easily see which IP addresses were in use by DIP-M pools. This also made it difficult to find SNDS feedback, which customers use to improve their reputation. Now, customers can see the IPs in DIP-M pools through the console, CLI, or SES API. SES also automatically creates CloudWatch Metrics for SNDS information on each IP address, which customers can access through the CloudWatch console or APIs. This gives customers more tools to monitor their sending reputation.\n  SES supports DIP-M IP observability in all AWS Regions where SES is available.\n  For more information, see the documentation for information about DIP-M pools.",

This feature introduces a new patch state called \"AvailableSecurityUpdate\" that reports security patches of all severity levels that are available to install on Windows instances but do not meet the approval rules in your patch baseline.\n  As organizations grow, administrators need to maintain secure systems while controlling when patches are applied. The security updates notification helps prevent situations where customers could unintentionally leave instances unpatched when using features like ApprovalDelay with large values. By default, instances with available security updates are marked as Non-Compliant, providing a clear signal that security patches require attention. Customers can also configure this behavior through their patch baseline settings to maintain existing compliance reporting if preferred.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Systems Manager is available. To get started with security updates notification for Windows patching compliance, visit the AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager console. For more information about this feature, refer to our user documentation or update your patch baseline with the details here. There are no additional charges for using this feature beyond standard AWS Systems Manager pricing.",

With this release, Amazon ECS allows you to specify a user ID in the \"user\" field of your Firelens containerDefinition element of your Task Definition, instead of only allowing \"user\": \"0\" (root user).\n  The new capability is supported in all AWS Regions. See the documentation for using Firelens for more details on how to set up your Firelens container to run as non-root.",

      "description": "Amazon Kinesis Data Streams now supports Fault Injection Service (FIS) actions for Kinesis API errors. Customers can now test their application's error handling capabilities, retry mechanisms (such as exponential backoff patterns), and CloudWatch alarms in a controlled environment. This allows customers to validate their monitoring systems and recovery processes before encountering real-world failures, ultimately improving application resilience and availability. This integration supports Kinesis Data Streams API errors including throttling, internal errors, service unavailable, and expired iterator exceptions for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.\n  Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless data streaming service that enables customers to capture, process, and store real-time data streams at any scale. Now customers can create real-world Kinesis Data Stream API errors (including 500, 503, and 400 errors for GET and PUT operations) to test application resilience. This feature eliminates the previous need for custom implementation or to wait for actual production failures to verify error handling mechanisms. To get started, customers can create experiment templates through the FIS console to run tests directly or integrate them into their continuous integration pipeline. For additional safety, FIS experiments include automatic stop mechanisms that trigger when customer-defined thresholds are reached, ensuring controlled testing without risking application stability.\n  These actions are generally available in all AWS Regions where FIS is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about using these actions, please see the Kinesis Data Streams User Guide and FIS User Guide.",

Along with these features, Apache Kafka version 4.1 includes various bug fixes and improvements. For more details, please refer to the Apache Kafka release notes for version 4.1. \n  A key highlight of Kafka 4.1 is the introduction of Queues as a preview feature. Customers can use multiple consumers to process messages from the same topic partitions, improving parallelism and throughput for workloads that need point-to-point message delivery. The new Streams Rebalance Protocol builds upon Kafka 4.0's consumer rebalance protocol, extending broker coordination capabilities to Kafka Streams for optimized task assignments and rebalancing. Additionally, ELR is now enabled by default to strengthen availability.\n  To start using Apache Kafka 4.1 on Amazon MSK, simply select version 4.1.x when creating a new cluster via the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. You can also upgrade existing MSK provisioned clusters with an in-place rolling update. Amazon MSK orchestrates broker restarts to maintain availability and protect your data during the upgrade.
