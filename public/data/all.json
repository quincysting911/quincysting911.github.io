With warm pools, customers can improve the elasticity of their applications by creating a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that are ready to quickly serve application traffic. By combining warm pools with instance type flexibility, an ASG can rapidly scale out to its maximum size at any time, deploying applications across multiple instance types to enhance availability.\n  Warm pools are particularly beneficial for applications with lengthy initialization processes, such as writing large amounts of data to disk, running complex custom scripts, or other time-consuming setup procedures that can take several minutes or longer to serve traffic. With this new release, the warm pool feature now works seamlessly with ASGs configured for multiple On-Demand instance types, whether specified through manual instance type lists or attribute-based instance type selection. The combination of instance type flexibility and warm pools provides a powerful solution that helps customers scale out efficiently while maximizing availability.\n  The warm pool feature is available through the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDKs, and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). It is available in all public AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more about warm pools, visit this AWS documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Kinesis Data Streams launches On-demand Advantage, so customers can warm on-demand streams to handle instant throughput increases up to 10GB or 10 million events per second, eliminating the need to over-provision or build custom scaling solutions. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale. On-demand streams automatically scale capacity based on data usage, and now you can warm write capacity ad hoc. On-demand Advantage also provides a simpler pricing structure that removes the fixed, per-stream charge, so customers only pay for data usage at better rates.\n  On-demand Advantage offers data usage with 60% lower pricing compared to On-demand Standard, with data ingest at $0.032/GB and data retrieval at $0.016/GB in the US East (N. Virginia) region. The price of Enhanced fan-out data retrieval is the same as shared-throughput retrievals, making higher fan-out use cases more cost effective. The mode also decreases the price of extended retention by 77% from $0.10/GB-month to $0.023/GB-month. Once you enable On-demand Advantage mode, the account will be billed for a minimum of 25MB/s of data ingest and 25MB/s of data retrieval at the lower rates across all on-demand streams. The new pricing means On-demand Advantage is the most cost effective way to stream with Kinesis Data Streams when you ingest at least 10MB/s in aggregate, fan out to more than two consumer applications, or have hundreds of streams in a region. You can check directly in the Kinesis console and the pricing page if On-demand Advantage is a good fit for your account.\n  On-demand Advantage is available in all AWS regions where Kinesis Data Streams is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) and China regions. To learn more, see the launch blog and the Kinesis Data Streams User Guide.",

      "description": "We're excited to announce a simplified pricing model for Amazon Cognito's machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication. Starting today we are removing the M2M app client pricing dimension, making it more cost-effective for customers to build and scale their M2M applications. Cognito supports applications that access API data with machine identities. Machine identities in user pools are clients that run on application servers and connect to remote APIs. Their operation happens without user interaction such as scheduled tasks, data streams, or asset updates. This change reduces the pricing of Cognito for customers using M2M authentication by removing the app client price dimension. Customers will continue to be charged based on the number of successful M2M token requests per month.\n  Previously, customers were charged for each M2M app client registered, regardless of usage amount, and each successful token request made by the app client to access a resource. With this change, customers will only pay for their successful token requests, making it more cost-effective to build and scale M2M applications using Amazon Cognito.\n  This pricing change is automatic and requires no action from customers. It is effective in all supported Amazon Cognito regions. To learn more about Amazon Cognito pricing, visit our pricing page.",

This means you can use applications such as CloudWatch agent or the OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector to publish the metrics into observability tools and create dashboards for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n  Previously, Mountpoint emitted operational data into log files, and you needed to create custom tools to parse the log files for insights. Now, when you mount your Amazon S3 bucket, you can configure Mountpoint to publish the metrics to an observability tool to proactively monitor issues that might impact your applications. For example, you can check if an application is unable to access S3 due to permission issues by analyzing the S3 request error metric that provides error types at an Amazon EC2 instance granularity.\n  Follow the step-by-step instructions to set up the CloudWatch agent or the OTel collector and configure Mountpoint to publish metrics into an observability tool.

These new strategies complement ECS built-in blue/green deployments, enabling you to choose the traffic shifting approach that best matches your application's risk profile and validation requirements.\n \nWith linear deployments, you can gradually shift traffic from your current service revision to the new revision in equal percentage increments over a specified time period. You configure the step percentage (for example, 10%) to control how much traffic shifts at each increment, and set a step bake time to wait between each traffic shift for monitoring and validation. This allows you to validate your new application version at multiple stages with increasing amounts of production traffic. With canary deployments, you can route a small percentage of production traffic to your new service revision while the majority of traffic remains on the current stable version. You set a canary bake time to monitor the new revision's performance, after which Amazon ECS shifts the remaining traffic to the new revision. Both strategies support a deployment bake time that waits after all production traffic has shifted to the new revision before terminating the old revision, enabling quick rollback without downtime if issues are detected. You can configure deployment lifecycle hooks to perform custom validation steps, and use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to automatically detect failures and trigger rollbacks.\n \nThe feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon ECS is available. You can use linear and canary deployment strategies for new and existing Amazon ECS services that use Application Load Balancer (ALB) or ECS Service Connect, using the Console, SDK, CLI, CloudFormation, CDK, and Terraform.

It joins the Instance Topology API in enabling customers to efficiently manage capacity, schedule jobs, and rank nodes for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and High-Performance Computing distributed workloads. The Capacity Reservation Topology API gives customers a unique per-account hierarchical view of the relative location of their capacity reservations.\n \nCustomers running distributed parallel workloads are managing thousands of instances across tens to hundreds of capacity reservations. With the Capacity Reservation Topology API, customers can describe the topology of their reservations as a network node set, which will show the relative proximity of their capacity without the need to launch an instance. This enables efficient capacity planning and management as customers provision workloads on tightly coupled capacity.

      "description": "The AWS Serverless Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server now supports specialized tools for AWS Lambda event source mappings (ESM), helping developers configure and manage ESMs more efficiently. These new tools combine the power of AI assistance with Lambda ESM expertise to streamline how developers set up, optimize, and troubleshoot event-driven serverless applications built on Lambda.\n  We previously launched the open-source Serverless MCP Server to enhance how developers build modern applications with AI-powered contextual guidance for architecture decisions, infrastructure provisioning, deployment automation, and troubleshooting of serverless applications. Starting today, we’re expanding the MCP server’s capabilities with new ESM tools that empower AI assistants, like Amazon Q Developer and Kiro, with proven knowledge of ESM patterns and best practices. The new ESM tools translate high-level throughput, latency, and reliability requirements into specific ESM configurations, generate complete AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) templates with optimized settings, validate network topology for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)-based event sources, and diagnose common ESM issues. Thus, these tools enhance the event-driven application development experience, guiding developers through the entire ESM lifecycle, from initial setup to optimization and troubleshooting. \n  The key new ESM tools being added to the Serverless MCP Server are: the ESM guidance tool for contextual guidance across all supported event sources, the ESM optimization tool for analyzing configuration tradeoffs, and the ESM Kafka troubleshooting tool for specialized diagnostics with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) and self-managed Apache Kafka clusters.\n  To learn more about the Serverless MCP Server and how it can transform your AI-assisted application development, visit the launch blog post and documentation.

This enhancement lets you seamlessly manage and discover cloud resources—such as Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon DynamoDB tables—across AWS accounts. By sharing your AWS Cloud Map namespace via AWS RAM, workloads in other accounts can discover and manage resources registered in that namespace. This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service discovery across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  You can now share your AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to maintain a centralized service registry—or a small set of registries—and share them across multiple accounts, simplifying service discovery. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. AWS Cloud Map's cross-account service discovery support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale service discovery as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to namespaces.\n  This feature is available now in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation.

It now enables agents to establish trusted, accountable access quickly and reduce CAPTCHA interruptions in automated workflows through Web Bot Auth, a draft IETF protocol that cryptographically identifies AI agents to websites. Traditional security measures like CAPTCHAs, rate limits, and blocks often halt automated workflows because Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) treat all automated traffic as suspicious - meaning AI agents frequently need human intervention to complete their tasks.\n  By enabling Web Bot Auth, AgentCore Browser streamlines bot verification across major security providers including Akamai Technologies, Cloudflare, and HUMAN Security. It automatically generates security credentials, signs HTTP requests with private keys, and registers verified identities - getting you started immediately without the need to register with multiple WAF providers or manage verification infrastructure.\n  Web Bot Auth support for AgentCore Browser is available in preview in all nine AWS Regions: US East (N.

With conditional copy, you can now verify if the object exists or has been modified in your destination S3 bucket before copying it. This helps you coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevents multiple concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object.\n  You can now perform conditional copy operations through S3 CopyObject by including either the HTTP if-none-match header to verify object existence or the HTTP if-match header with ETag to validate the object’s content. Additionally, you can use the s3:if-match and s3:if-none-match condition keys in your S3 bucket policies to enforce conditional copy operations. S3 then evaluates the condition against the specified object's key or ETag before executing the copy operation in the destination bucket. This eliminates the need for additional client-side coordination mechanisms or API validation requests.\n  Conditional copy is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions in both S3 general purpose and directory buckets. You can use the AWS SDK, API, or CLI to copy data conditionally to your buckets. To learn more about conditional operations, visit the S3 User Guide.",

PlannerVersion 2.0 for Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) 5.0 delivers up to 10x performance improvement over the prior version when using find and update operators with indexes. Performance improvements primarily come from using more optimal index plans and enabling index scan support for operators such as negation operators ($neq, $nin) and nested $elementMatch. PlannerVersion 2.0 queries run faster through better cost estimation techniques, optimized algorithms, and enhanced stability.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 also simplifies query syntax. For example, you no longer need to provide explicit hints for $regex queries to utilize indexes.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon DocumentDB 5.0 is supported. You can enable it by simply modifying the corresponding parameter in your cluster parameter group. The change does not require a cluster restart or cause any downtime. If needed, you can easily revert to using the legacy query planner. To learn more about the new query planner, see Getting Started with New Query Planner.",

These two metrics, Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check, monitor if the driven IOPS or throughput is exceeding the maximum EBS IOPS or throughput that your instance can support.\n  With these two new metrics at the instance level, you can quickly identify and respond to application performance issues stemming from exceeding the EBS-Optimized limits of your instance. These metrics will return a value of 0 (performance not exceeded) or a 1 (performance exceeded) when your workload is exceeding the EBS-Optimized IOPS or throughput limit of the EC2 instance. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can use these new metrics to create customized dashboards and set alarms that notify you or automatically perform actions based on these metrics, such as moving to a larger instance size or a different instance type that supports higher EBS-Optimized limits.\n  The Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check metrics are available by default at a 1-minute frequency at no additional charges, for all Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instances with EBS volumes attached. You can access these metrics via the EC2 console, CLI, or CloudWatch API in all Commercial AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions.

With increase in maximum payload size to 1MB for asynchronous invocations, developers can streamline their architectures by including comprehensive data, from detailed user profiles to complete transaction histories, in a single event, eliminating the need for complex data chunking or external storage solutions.\n  This feature is generally available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Customers can start sending asynchronous invocation payloads up to 1 MB using Lambda’s invoke API. Customers are charged for 1 request per each asynchronous invocation for first 256 KB.

      "description": "Amazon Connect outbound campaigns now offers a preview dialing mode that gives agents more context about a customer before placing a call. Agents can see key customer information—such as name, account balance, and prior interactions—and choose the right moment to call. Campaign managers can tailor preview settings and monitor performance through new dashboards that bring visibility to agent behavior, campaign outcomes, and customer engagement trends.\n  Without proper context, agents struggle to personalize interactions, leading to low customer engagement and poor experiences. Additionally, businesses can face steep regulatory penalties under laws such as the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) or the UK Office of Communications (OFCOM) for delays in customer-agent connection.\n  With preview dialing, campaign managers can define review time limits and optionally enable contact removal from campaigns. During preview, agents see a countdown timer alongside customer data and can initiate calls at any moment. Analytics reveal performance patterns—such as average preview time or discard volume—giving managers data to optimize strategy and coach teams effectively. By reserving an agent prior to placing the call, companies can support compliance with regulations while bringing precision to outbound calling, improving both customer connection and operational control.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage. Preview dialing is available in AWS regions, including US East (N.
