      "description": "Amazon CloudFront announces support for mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for origins, a security protocol that enables customers to verify that requests to their origin servers come only from their authorized CloudFront distributions using TLS certificates. This certificate-based authentication provides cryptographic verification of CloudFront's identity, eliminating the need for customers to manage custom security controls.\n  Previously, verifying that requests came from CloudFront distributions required customers to build and maintain custom authentication solutions like shared secret headers or IP allow-lists, particularly for public or externally hosted origins. These approaches required ongoing operational overhead to rotate secrets, update allow-lists, and maintain custom code. Now with origin mTLS support, customers can implement a standardized, certificate-based authentication approach that eliminates this operational burden. This enables organizations to enforce strict authentication for their proprietary content, ensuring that only verified CloudFront distributions can establish connections to backend infrastructure ranging from AWS origins and on-premises servers to third-party cloud providers and external CDNs. Customers can leverage client certificates issued by AWS Private Certificate Authority or third-party private Certificate Authorities, which they import through AWS Certificate Manager.\n  Customers can configure origin mTLS using the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDK, CDK, or CloudFormation. Origin mTLS is supported for all origins that support mutual TLS on AWS such as Application Load Balancer and API Gateway, as well as on-premises and custom origins. There is no additional charge for origin mTLS. Origin mTLS is also available in the Business and Premium flat-rate pricing plans. For detailed implementation guidance and best practices, visit the CloudFront origin mutual TLS documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon RDS for Oracle now supports cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes. With additional storage volumes, customers can add up to three storage volumes, each with up to 64 TiB, in addition to the primary storage volume for their database instance. As a result, customers get flexibility to add or remove storage with evolving workload demands, without incurring application downtime, and set up their database instance with up to 256 TiB storage. Now, with support for cross-Region replicas, customers that set up database instances with cross-Region replicas for business-critical applications also get the benefit of using additional storage volumes for storage flexibility.\n  When you create a cross-Region replica for a database instance that is set up with additional storage volumes, Amazon RDS for Oracle automatically configures the same storage layout on the replica. Subsequently, you can apply changes to additional storage volumes on the primary instance and the replica using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a cross-Region replica to serve as the new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica to meet low recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for business critical applications.\n  You will need an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license to use replicas in mounted mode, and an additional Oracle Active Data Guard license to use replicas in read-only mode. We recommend consulting your legal team or licensing expert to verify Oracle license requirements for your specific use case. Amazon RDS for Oracle cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes is available in all AWS Regions including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

      "description": "AWS announces the launch of deployment Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) available in the AWS MCP Server. SOPs are structured, natural language instructions that guide AI agents through complex, multi-step tasks to ensure consistent, reliable, and efficient behavior. With these automated procedures, customers can deploy web applications to their AWS account using natural language prompts from any MCP-compatible IDE or CLI, including Kiro, Kiro CLI, Cursor, and Claude Code. Deployment works by generating AWS CDK infrastructure, deploying CloudFormation stacks, and creating CI/CD pipelines with recommended AWS security best practices.\n  Previously, developers struggled to take their vibe-coded applications to production with DevOps best practices in place. Now, developers can move quickly from prototype to production in as little as one prompt. When you ask your AI assistant configured with AWS MCP Server to deploy your web application, your AI agent will follow the multi-step plan defined in Agent SOPs to analyze the project structure, generate CDK infrastructure, and deploy a preview environment hosted on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. Once you are ready, it can configure AWS CodePipeline for automated production deployments from source repositories, setting up CI/CD automatically for your application. The Agent SOPs support web applications built with popular frameworks including React, Vue.js, Angular, and Next.js. Deployment documentation is automatically created in the repository, enabling agents to handle future deployments, query logs for troubleshooting and resume work across sessions.\n  The Agent SOPs are available in preview as part of the AWS MCP Server at no additional cost in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You pay only for AWS resources you create and applicable data transfer costs. To get started, see the AWS MCP Server documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon GameLift Servers now enables automatic scaling to and from zero instances, addressing a critical cost optimization challenge for game developers. Previously, developers had to maintain running instances even during periods of low or no activity in order for Fleet autoscaling to remain active. This resulted in unnecessary infrastructure costs during off-peak hours. With automatic scaling to and from zero instances, game developers using Amazon GameLift Servers can optimize their multiplayer gaming infrastructure costs while maintaining responsive performance.\n  By eliminating charges for unused instances during inactive periods, while automatically scaling up when game sessions are requested, this new capability delivers significant cost savings for game developers. This is particularly valuable for games with distinct peak and off-peak periods, seasonal or event-based games, new game launches with uncertain traffic patterns, and regional games with time-zone specific activity. Additionally, scaling decisions no longer need manual intervention, as Amazon GameLift Servers intelligently adapts to natural gaming activity patterns.\n  The automatic scaling to zero instances capability is available in all Amazon GameLift Servers supported regions. To learn more about Amazon GameLift Servers automatic scaling capabilities and implementation details, visit the Amazon GameLift Servers documentation.",

Monthly billing is ideal for predictable full-time desktops and hourly billing is ideal for variable usage patterns. Both options are pay-as-you-go with no long-term commitments.\n  Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances simplifies virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) migrations with highly customizable instance configurations. WorkSpaces Core managed instances provisions resources in your AWS account, handling infrastructure lifecycle management for both persistent and non-persistent workloads. Monthly pricing delivers savings vs hourly billing at always-on utilization, optimized for real-world VDI use cases.\n  With flexible billing, customers benefit from predictable costs for persistent desktop workloads and the flexibility to mix hourly and monthly billing within the same deployment. VDI partners utilizing WorkSpaces Core managed instances including Citrix, Workspot, Dizzion, and Leostream can now integrate with new WorkSpaces API billing features to enable the monthly billing option when instances are created. Hourly billing remains the default billing option for managed instances.\n  In addition, starting today, hourly utility rates for WorkSpaces Core managed instances will now be combined and billed by Amazon WorkSpaces to simplify pricing. Previously, hourly rates were split between Amazon EC2 and Amazon WorkSpaces on customer bills. There is no change to the effective rates for on-demand hourly usage of WorkSpaces Core Managed Instances with this announcement.\n  To learn more about Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances flexible billing, visit the WorkSpaces for VDI partners pricing page.

This condition key is used with the DeleteAutoScalingGroup action to control whether the ForceDelete parameter can be used during deletion, which determines if an Auto Scaling group (ASG) can be deleted while it still contains running instances. You can use this condition key in IAM policies to restrict deletion permissions. This provides a safety measure to prevent accidental deletion of ASGs that still have running instances.\n  Furthermore, EC2 Auto Scaling now offers deletion protection at the group level. The new deletion-protection configuration can be set either when you create your ASGs or update them. This new feature lets you set enhanced controls based on your workload's criticality, with multiple protection levels available to safeguard against accidental deletions and help maintain application availability.\n  Combining the autoscaling:ForceDelete condition key with deletion protection at the group level provides a layered defense against unwanted ASG termination by allowing you to both restrict IAM permissions for force-delete operations and set enhanced protection controls directly on critical ASGs.\n  The features now available in all AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

Oracle multi-tenant configuration allows customers to host multiple, isolated pluggable databases in a single container database, which allows for cost reduction through consolidation and easier management. With support for replicas in Oracle multi-tenant configuration, customers can now distribute read workloads to a replica to scale workloads, or setup cross-Region replicas. In disaster recovery situations, customers can promote replicas to serve as a new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica for a quick recovery.\n \nTo set up replicas in Oracle multi-tenant configuration, customers can create a replica in either mounted or read-only mode using the AWS management console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. Once a replica is set up, Amazon RDS for Oracle manages asynchronous physical replication between primary and replica database instances using Oracle Data Guard.\n \nAmazon RDS for Oracle read replicas use Oracle Data Guard. Using mounted mode replicas require an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license, and using read-only mode replicas require additional Oracle Active Data Guard licenses. We recommend customers to consult their Oracle licensing expert to determine Oracle licensing requirements.

      "description": "Today, Amazon Bedrock introduces the expansion of the Reserved service tier designed for workloads requiring predictable performance and guaranteed tokens-per-minute capacity. The Reserved tier provides the ability to reserve prioritized compute capacity, keeping service levels predictable for your mission critical applications. It also includes the flexibility to allocate different input and output tokens-per-minute capacities to match the exact requirements of your workload and control cost. This is particularly valuable because many workloads have asymmetric token usage patterns. For instance, summarization tasks consume many input tokens but generate fewer output tokens, while content generation applications require less input and more output capacity. When your application needs more tokens-per-minute capacity than what you reserved , the service automatically overflows to the pay-as-you-go Standard tier, ensuring uninterrupted operations. The Reserved tier is available today for Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 in AWS GovCloud (US-West). Customers can reserve capacity for 1 month or 3 month duration. Customers pay a fixed price per 1K tokens-per-minute and are billed monthly. Amazon Bedrock Reserved Tier is available for customers in AWS GovCloud (US-West) via GOV-CRIS cross-region profile.\n  With the expansion of the Reserved service tier, Amazon Bedrock continues to provide more choice to customers, helping them develop, scale, and deploy applications and agents that improve productivity and customer experiences while balancing performance and cost requirements.\n  For more information about the AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Reserved tier is available, refer to the Documentation.

This launch expedites troubleshooting when you have multiple policies of the same type, as you can directly see which policy to address for explicit deny cases. The error message now includes the policy ARN for Service Control Policies (SCP), Resource Control Policies (RCP), identity-based policies, session policies, and permission boundaries.\n  This additional context will gradually become available across AWS services in all AWS regions.

      "description": "Today AWS announced enhanced scheduling orchestration to track AWS tagging events, self-service troubleshooting via informational resource tags, an optional EC2 insufficient-capacity retry flow using alternate instance types, and automatic creation of a dedicated EventBridge bus for scheduling events for Instance Scheduler (IS) on AWS. IS’s orchestration and fan-out mechanisms have been re-architected to enable customers to track AWS tagging events, allowing the product to more intelligently sequence and distribute scheduling operations - improving scaling performance and addressing cost-scaling concerns. The product now enables distributed cloud engineer personas to perform self-service troubleshooting in their spoke accounts through informational tags applied to their resources without relying on a central cloud administrator. In addition, an optional Insufficient Capacity Error Retry flow has been added to automatically retry failed start actions using alternate instance types when EC2 encounters insufficient capacity errors, ensuring workloads start reliably even in constrained Availability Zones or regions. Lastly, Instance Scheduler on AWS now automatically creates a dedicated EventBus for scheduling-related events, streamlining integrations and automation workflows.\n \nThis update improves Instance Scheduler’s scalability, reduces operational overhead, and increases workload reliability across complex customer environments. You can accelerate issue resolution and boost operational efficiency by empowering distributed cloud engineers to troubleshoot independently. You can enhance overall workload resilience by improving handling of EC2 capacity shortages and simplify integrations by streamlining event routing through the new EventBus to support more extensible automation workflows.\n \nTo learn more about Instance Scheduler, visit the Product Page or contact your AWS account team.",

      "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) now supports faster Blue/Green Deployments switchover, reducing your primary database, or writer node, upgrade downtime to typically five seconds or lower for single-Region configurations. Blue/Green Deployment creates a staging environment (Green) to test changes while keeping production (Blue) safe, enabling seamless switchover that requires no application endpoint changes.\n  Your database writer instance downtime during switchover varies based on your connection method. For single-Region configurations, applications connecting directly to the database endpoint experience typically five seconds or lower downtime, while those using the AWS Advanced JDBC Driver typically see two seconds or lower due to eliminated DNS propagation delays. You can use Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments for deploying changes to production, such as major version database engine upgrades, maintenance updates, and scaling instances.\n  Support for faster RDS Blue/Green Deployments switchover for single-Region configurations is available for Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS database engines including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB in all AWS regions.\n  In a few clicks, update your databases using RDS Blue/Green Deployments via the Amazon RDS Console or Amazon RDS CLI.

      "description": "Today, Amazon Bedrock announces the expansion of the Reserved service tier designed for workloads requiring predictable performance and guaranteed tokens-per-minute capacity. The Reserved tier provides the ability to reserve prioritized compute capacity, keeping service levels predictable for your mission critical applications. It also includes the flexibility to allocate different input and output tokens-per-minute capacities to match the exact requirements of your workload and control cost. This is particularly valuable because many workloads have asymmetric token usage patterns. For instance, summarization tasks consume many input tokens but generate fewer output tokens, while content generation applications require less input and more output capacity. When your application needs more tokens-per-minute capacity than what you reserved , the service automatically overflows to the pay-as-you-go Standard tier, ensuring uninterrupted operations. The Reserved tier and is available today for Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5. Customers can reserve capacity for 1 month or 3 month duration. Customers pay a fixed price per 1K tokens-per-minute and are billed monthly.\n  With the expansion of the Reserved service tier, Amazon Bedrock continues to provide more choice to customers, helping them develop, scale, and deploy applications and agents that improve productivity and customer experiences while balancing performance and cost requirements.\n  For more information about the AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Reserved tier is available, refer to the Documentation.

      "description": "Today, AWS Deadline Cloud announces integration with Foundry Nuke CopyCat, allowing you to run machine learning training jobs for visual effects in the cloud. AWS Deadline Cloud is a fully managed service that simplifies render management for computer-generated 2D/3D graphics and visual effects for films, TV shows, commercials, games, and industrial design.\n  CopyCat learns visual effects, such as color corrections, beauty finishes, or deblurring, from a set of adjusted frames and automatically applies these adjustments across entire sequences. Instead of cleaning up frames one by one, you can fix a handful of representative frames and CopyCat will automatically apply these changes to the rest of your footage, saving you significant amounts of valuable time. With this integration, you can now train models by submitting CopyCat training jobs directly to your Deadline Cloud render farm. This gives you the ability to scale and run multiple training workloads in parallel while freeing up your artist workstations for creative work. You can monitor and track training jobs alongside other render jobs through the Deadline Cloud interface for one simple view across an entire project.\n  AWS Deadline Cloud with Nuke CopyCat integration is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Deadline Cloud is supported.
