Amazon Q Developer is the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development. With this launch, customers can now use Amazon Q Developer to get information about AWS product and service pricing, availability, and attributes, helping them select the right resources and estimate workload costs using natural language.\n  When architecting new workloads on AWS, customers need to estimate costs so they can evaluate cost/performance tradeoffs, set budgets, and plan future spending. Customers can now use Amazon Q Developer to retrieve detailed product attribute and pricing information using natural language, making it easier to estimate the cost of new workloads without having to review multiple pricing pages or specify detailed API request parameters. Customers can now ask questions about service pricing (e.g., “How much does RDS extended support cost?”), the cost of a planned workload (e.g., “I need to send 1 million notifications per month to email, and 1 million to HTTP/S endpoints. Estimate the monthly cost using SNS.”), or the relative costs of different resources (e.g., “What is the cost difference between an Application Load Balancer and a Network Load Balancer?”). To answer these questions, Amazon Q Developer retrieves information from the AWS Price List APIs.\n  To learn more, see Managing your costs using generative AI with Amazon Q Developer.

      "description": "Starting today, Amazon VPC Lattice lets you configure the number of IPv4 addresses assigned to resource gateway elastic network interfaces (ENIs). This enhancement builds on VPC Lattice's capability of providing access to resources on Layer-4 such as databases, clusters, domain names, etc. across multiple VPCs and accounts.\n  When configuring a resource gateway, you can now specify the number of IPv4 addresses per ENI, which becomes immutable after setting. The IPv4 addresses are used for network address translation and determine the maximum number of concurrent IPv4 connections to a resource. You should consider your expected connection volume when configuring the IPv4 address count. By default, VPC Lattice assigns 16 IPv4 addresses per ENI. For IPv6, VPC Lattice always assigns a /80 CIDR per ENI.\n  This feature is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where VPC Lattice is offered. For more information, visit the Amazon VPC Lattice product detail page and Amazon VPC Lattice documentation.",

For sellers, this means faster deal cycles, simplified cash flow management in local currency, and the ability to close larger deals with confidence. For AWS Marketplace buyers, software and services can now be procured in their preferred currency, eliminating foreign exchange risk in invoice amounts, and streamlining the procurement process for private offers.\n  Sellers can now create private offers in EUR, GBP, AUD, and JPY, and receive their disbursements in the offer currency, regardless of pricing types, including contract with consumption-based pricing and usage-based (pay-as-you-go) pricing, in addition to contract-only pricing. For Channel Partner Private Offers (CPPO), the seller, channel partner, and buyer must all transact in the same currency. Sellers need to issue a resale authorization in the negotiated currency, and the channel partner then creates the CPPO in that currency.\n  This functionality is available worldwide for all AWS Marketplace Sellers for all private offers. Public offers remain in USD only.\n  AWS Marketplace Sellers can choose to get disbursed to a bank account in one of the eligible jurisdictions by updating your banking information and set your currency preferences in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal Settings page.

The self-service edition upgrade eliminates the need for support tickets when scaling Managed Microsoft AD directories.\n  The API-driven Standard to Enterprise Edition upgrade removes operational barriers that previously required coordinating maintenance windows with AWS support, enabling on-demand directory scaling with automated pre-upgrade snapshots and sequential domain controller upgrades. This streamlined process ensures data protection through automatic backup creation before upgrades begin, while the sequential upgrade approach maintains directory availability throughout the process.\n  Organizations can now scale their directory infrastructure in response to growing user bases or expanding application requirements without the delays associated with traditional support-driven upgrade processes. The programmatic approach enables integration with existing automation frameworks and infrastructure-as-code deployments.\n Directory size upgrades are available in all AWS Directory Service regions through the AWS SDK, providing consistent upgrade capabilities across global deployments.\n  To learn more, see the AWS Directory Service documentation and UpdateDirectorySetup API reference.",

With Managed Login, Cognito customers could previously use its no-code editor to customize the user journey from signup and login to password recovery and multi-factor authentication. Now, customers can additionally use Managed Login to easily set up terms of use and privacy policy documents, saving development teams from building custom solutions.\n  With this capability, you can configure terms of use and privacy policy URLs for each app client in your Cognito user pool. When users register, they see text indicating that by signing up, they agree to your terms of use and privacy policy, and a link to your webpage with the agreement. You can configure different URLs for each supported language to match your Managed Login localization settings. For example, if you have configured the privacy policy and terms of use documents for French (fr) and the same is selected in the lang query-parameter on the sign-up page URL, users will see the French URL you configured.\n  This capability is available to Amazon Cognito customers using the Essentials or Plus tiers in AWS Regions where Cognito is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

      "description": "Today, we’re announcing the integration of Amazon Neptune Database with GraphStorm, a scalable, open-source graph machine learning (ML) library built for enterprise-scale applications. This brings together Neptune’s OLTP (Online transaction processing) graph capabilities with GraphStorm’s scalable inference engine, making it easier for customers to deploy graph ML in latency-sensitive, transactional environments.\n  With this integration, developers can train GNN models using GraphStorm and deploy them as real-time inference endpoints that directly query Neptune for subgraph neighborhoods on demand. Predictions—such as node classifications or link predictions—can then be returned in sub-second timeframes, closing the loop between transactional graph updates and ML-driven decisions. This integration unlocks use cases such as fraud detection and prevention, where organizations can make real-time decisions based on complex relationships among accounts, devices, and transactions; dynamic recommendations, where systems can instantly adapt to user behavior using live graph context; and graph-based risk scoring, where risk assessments are continuously updated as the graph evolves. Customers can also combine real-time inference results with graph analytics queries for deeper operational insights, enabling ML feedback loops directly within graph applications.\n  This feature is available in all regions where Amazon Neptune Database is available. To learn more and try the integration yourself, check out our announcement blog: Modernize fraud prevention: GraphStorm v0.5 for real-time inference for a full walk-through.",

Additionally, BDA expands support for blueprint creation using a guided and natural language-based interface for extracting custom insights to audio modality. BDA is a feature of Amazon Bedrock that automates generation of insights from unstructured multimodal content such as documents, images, audio, and videos for your GenAI-powered applications. With this launch, developers can now enable speaker diarization and channel identification in standard output. Speaker diarization detects each unique speaker and tracks speaker changes in a multi-party audio conversation. Channel identification enables separate processing of audio from each channel. For example, speakers such as a customer and sales agent can be separated into unique channels, making it easier to analyze the transcript.\n  Speaker diarization and channel identification make transcripts easier to read and extract custom insights from a variety of multi-party voice conversations such as customer calls, education sessions, public safety calls, clinical discussions, and meetings. This enables customers to identify ways to improve employee productivity, add subtitles to webinars, enhance customer experience, or increase regulatory compliance. For example, Telehealth customers can summarize the recommendations of a doctor by assigning the doctors and patients to pre-identified channels.\n  Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is available in a total of 7 AWS Regions in US West (Oregon), US East (N.

You get an always-on, out-of-the-box catalog and map that visualizes services and dependencies across AWS accounts and regions, organizing them into logical groups that align with how customers think about their systems—without manual configurations. You can also apply dynamic grouping based on how you organize applications—by teams, business units, criticality tiers, or other attributes.\n  With this new application performance monitoring (APM) capability, customers can quickly visualize which applications and dependencies to focus on while troubleshooting their distributed applications. For example, SRE and DevOps teams can now accelerate root cause analysis and reduce mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) through high-level operational signals such as SLOs, health indicators, changes, and top observations. The application map integrates with a contextual troubleshooting drawer that surfaces relevant metrics and actionable insights to accelerate triage. When deeper investigation is needed, teams can pivot to an application-specific dashboard tailored for troubleshooting. The map, drawer, and dashboard dynamically update as new services are discovered or as customers adjust how their environments are grouped—ensuring the view is always accurate and aligned with how teams operate.\n  This new capability is now available in all AWS commercial regions where Application Signals have launched , at no additional cost.

Organizations can define granular permissions based on identity provider credentials for Spark sessions and SageMaker Studio notebook flows, including training and processing jobs. This integration is complemented by comprehensive AWS CloudTrail logging of all user activities—from interactive JupyterLab sessions to user background sessions - streamlining compliance monitoring and audit requirements.\n  Identity support for Spark sessions in SageMaker Unified Studio is available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), South America (São Paulo), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo).\n  To learn more, visit the SageMaker Unified Studio documentation.",

      "description": "Today, AWS announces the launch of Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Managed Instances, a new fully managed compute option designed to eliminate infrastructure management overhead while giving you access to the full capabilities of Amazon EC2. By offloading infrastructure operations to AWS, ECS Managed Instances helps you quickly launch and scale your workloads, while enhancing performance and reducing your total cost of ownership.\n  With ECS Managed Instances, you get the application performance you want and the simplicity you need. Simply define your task requirements such as the number of vCPUs, memory size, and CPU architecture, and Amazon ECS automatically provisions, configures and operates most optimal EC2 instances within your AWS account using AWS-controlled access. You can also specify desired instance types in Managed Instances Capacity Provider configuration, including GPU-accelerated, network-optimized, and burstable performance, to run your workloads on the instance families you prefer.\n  ECS Managed Instances dynamically scales EC2 instances to match your workload requirements and continuously optimizes task placement to reduce infrastructure costs. It also enhances your security posture through regular security patching initiated every 14 days. You can use EC2 event windows to schedule patching to occur within weekly maintenance windows, minimizing the risk of interruptions during critical hours.\n  ECS Managed Instances is now available in six AWS regions: US East (North Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). To get started with ECS Managed Instances, use the AWS Console, Amazon ECS MCP Server, or your favorite infrastructure-as-code tooling to enable it in a new or existing Amazon ECS cluster. You will be charged for the management of compute provisioned, in addition to your regular Amazon EC2 costs. To learn more about ECS Managed Instances, visit the feature page, documentation, and AWS News launch blog.",

With this launch, Amazon ECS tasks and services can run using only IPv6 addresses, without requiring IPv4. This enables customers to deploy containerized applications in IPv6-only environments, scale without being limited by IPv4 address availability, and meet IPv6 compliance requirements through native IPv6 support in Amazon ECS.\n  Previously, Amazon ECS tasks always required an IPv4 address, even when launched in dual-stack subnets. This requirement could create scaling and management challenges for customers operating large fleets of containerized applications, where IPv4 address space became a bottleneck. With IPv6-only support, Amazon ECS tasks launched in IPv6-only subnets use only IPv6 addresses. This removes IPv4 as a dependency and helps organizations that must meet IPv6 adoption or regulatory mandates.\n  The feature works across all Amazon ECS launch types and can be used with awsvpc, bridge, and host networking modes. To get started, create IPv6-only subnets in your VPC and launch Amazon ECS services or tasks in those subnets. Amazon ECS automatically detects the configuration and provisions the appropriate networking. To learn more about IPv6-only task networking and supported AWS Regions, see the Amazon ECS task networking documentation for AWS Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type.

Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
