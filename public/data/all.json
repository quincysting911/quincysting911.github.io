      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) announces support for linear and canary deployment strategies, giving you more flexibility and control when deploying containerized applications. These new strategies complement ECS built-in blue/green deployments, enabling you to choose the traffic shifting approach that best matches your application's risk profile and validation requirements.\n \nWith linear deployments, you can gradually shift traffic from your current service revision to the new revision in equal percentage increments over a specified time period. You configure the step percentage (for example, 10%) to control how much traffic shifts at each increment, and set a step bake time to wait between each traffic shift for monitoring and validation. This allows you to validate your new application version at multiple stages with increasing amounts of production traffic. With canary deployments, you can route a small percentage of production traffic to your new service revision while the majority of traffic remains on the current stable version. You set a canary bake time to monitor the new revision's performance, after which Amazon ECS shifts the remaining traffic to the new revision. Both strategies support a deployment bake time that waits after all production traffic has shifted to the new revision before terminating the old revision, enabling quick rollback without downtime if issues are detected. You can configure deployment lifecycle hooks to perform custom validation steps, and use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to automatically detect failures and trigger rollbacks.\n \nThe feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon ECS is available. You can use linear and canary deployment strategies for new and existing Amazon ECS services that use Application Load Balancer (ALB) or ECS Service Connect, using the Console, SDK, CLI, CloudFormation, CDK, and Terraform.

This enhancement lets you seamlessly manage and discover cloud resources—such as Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon DynamoDB tables—across AWS accounts. By sharing your AWS Cloud Map namespace via AWS RAM, workloads in other accounts can discover and manage resources registered in that namespace. This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service discovery across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  You can now share your AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access.

      "description": "We are excited to announce the Amazon OCSF Ready Specialization that recognizes AWS Partners who have technically validated their software solutions to integrate with OCSF-compatible Amazon services with proven customer success in production environments. The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) is an open-source initiative that simplifies how security data is normalized and shared across your security tools. This validation ensures customers can confidently select solutions that will help them improve their security operations through standardized data formats, leading to efficient threat detection, vulnerability identification, and enhanced security analytics.\n  The AWS Service Ready Program provides customers with AWS Partner software solutions that work with AWS Services. This specialization helps you quickly find and deploy pre-validated AWS Partner solutions that work seamlessly with OCSF-compatible Amazon services, reducing the complexity of your security operations. Partners can participate in the Amazon OCSF Ready designation by either sending logs and security events in the OCSF schema, or receiving logs or security events from OCSF-compatible Amazon services. This standardization helps customers to collect, combine, and analyze security data reducing the time and effort needed for security operations.\n  Amazon OCSF Ready Partners receive AWS Specialization Program benefits, and have access to signature benefits, including private strategy sessions and AWS guest speaker support for virtual events. The Amazon OCSF specialization expands and replaces the Amazon Security Lake Specialization.\n  To learn more about how to become an Amazon OCSF Ready Partner, visit the AWS Service Ready Program webpage.",

This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.\n  You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and TCP). This feature is available in all regions where Amazon ECS Service Connect is supported.

It now enables agents to establish trusted, accountable access quickly and reduce CAPTCHA interruptions in automated workflows through Web Bot Auth, a draft IETF protocol that cryptographically identifies AI agents to websites. Traditional security measures like CAPTCHAs, rate limits, and blocks often halt automated workflows because Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) treat all automated traffic as suspicious - meaning AI agents frequently need human intervention to complete their tasks.\n  By enabling Web Bot Auth, AgentCore Browser streamlines bot verification across major security providers including Akamai Technologies, Cloudflare, and HUMAN Security. It automatically generates security credentials, signs HTTP requests with private keys, and registers verified identities - getting you started immediately without the need to register with multiple WAF providers or manage verification infrastructure.\n  Web Bot Auth support for AgentCore Browser is available in preview in all nine AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland).\n  Learn more about this feature through the blog, see the Reduce CAPTCHAs with Web Bot Auth documentation to get started with Web Bot Auth in Browser.

This launch enables customers to publish intermittent larger data payloads in their data streams while continuing to use existing Kinesis Data Streams APIs in their applications. This launch is accompanied by a 2x increase in the maximum PutRecords request size from 5MiB to 10MiB.\n  Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless data streaming service that enables customers to capture, process, and store real-time data streams at any scale. With this launch, customers no longer need to maintain separate processing pipelines for handling intermittent large records, and can thus simplify their data pipelines. This reduces operational overhead for IoT analytics, change data capture, and generative AI workloads. You can update your stream's maximum record size up to 10 MiB using either the AWS Management Console or the UpdateMaxRecordSize API via the AWS SDK or CLI. Once your stream is configured, you can publish and consume larger records using existing Kinesis Data Streams APIs. You do not incur additional costs to use this capability beyond your regular Kinesis data streams charges.\n  In conjunction with this launch, AWS Lambda now supports larger payloads up to 6MiB from Kinesis Data Streams.\n  Amazon Kinesis Data Streams supports large records in the AWS Regions documented here.

It is the first unified embedding model that supports text, documents, images, video, and audio through a single model, to enable cross-modal retrieval with leading accuracy.\n  Managing and searching across different content types traditionally required multiple specialized embedding models, leading to complexity, higher costs, and data silos. Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings maps diverse content types into a unified space with leading accuracy, helping break down these silos. Developers can build cross-modal applications that search video archives using complex queries, find relevant product images based on customer questions, or search financial documentation that contain both infographics and text explanations, all using a single embedding model.\n  The model supports inputs of up to 8K tokens in length and video/audio segments up to 30 seconds, with the capability to segment larger files. Multiple output embedding dimensions allow organizations to balance accuracy and performance with storage and computation costs. Organizations can choose between synchronous API for near real-time applications and asynchronous API for efficient processing of larger files, enabling them to optimize for both latency-sensitive and high-volume workloads.\n  Amazon Nova Multimodal Embeddings is available in US East (N. Virginia) in Amazon Bedrock.\n  To learn more, read the AWS News blog and user guide. To get started with Nova Multimodal Embeddings in Amazon Bedrock, visit the Amazon Bedrock console.",

ECS Managed Instances is a fully managed compute option designed to eliminate infrastructure management overhead while giving you access to the full capabilities of Amazon EC2. By offloading infrastructure operations to AWS, you get the application performance you want and the simplicity you need while reducing your total cost of ownership.\n  Managed Instances dynamically scales EC2 instances to match your workload requirements and continuously optimizes task placement to reduce infrastructure costs. It also enhances your security posture through regular security patching initiated every 14 days. You can simply define your task requirements such as the number of vCPUs, memory size, and CPU architecture, and Amazon ECS automatically provisions, configures and operates most optimal EC2 instances within your AWS account using AWS-controlled access. You can also specify desired instance types in Managed Instances Capacity Provider configuration, including GPU-accelerated, network-optimized, and burstable performance, to run your workloads on the instance families you prefer.\n  To get started with ECS Managed Instances, use the AWS Console, Amazon ECS MCP Server, or your favorite infrastructure-as-code tooling to enable it in a new or existing Amazon ECS cluster. You will be charged for the management of compute provisioned, in addition to your regular Amazon EC2 costs.

      "description": "Amazon Connect outbound campaigns now offers a preview dialing mode that gives agents more context about a customer before placing a call. Agents can see key customer information—such as name, account balance, and prior interactions—and choose the right moment to call. Campaign managers can tailor preview settings and monitor performance through new dashboards that bring visibility to agent behavior, campaign outcomes, and customer engagement trends.\n  Without proper context, agents struggle to personalize interactions, leading to low customer engagement and poor experiences. Additionally, businesses can face steep regulatory penalties under laws such as the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) or the UK Office of Communications (OFCOM) for delays in customer-agent connection.\n  With preview dialing, campaign managers can define review time limits and optionally enable contact removal from campaigns. During preview, agents see a countdown timer alongside customer data and can initiate calls at any moment. Analytics reveal performance patterns—such as average preview time or discard volume—giving managers data to optimize strategy and coach teams effectively. By reserving an agent prior to placing the call, companies can support compliance with regulations while bringing precision to outbound calling, improving both customer connection and operational control.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage. Preview dialing is available in AWS regions, including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London).\n  To learn more about configuring preview dialing, visit our webpage.",

      "description": "Stifel Financial Corp, a diversified financial services holding company is expanding its data landscape that requires an orchestration solution capable of managing increasingly complex data pipeline operations across multiple business domains. Traditional time-based scheduling systems fall short in addressing the dynamic interdependencies between data products, requires event-driven orchestration. Key challenges include coordinating cross-domain dependencies, maintaining data consistency across business units, meeting stringent SLAs, and scaling effectively as data volumes grow. Without a flexible orchestration solution, these issues can lead to delayed business operations and insights, increased operational overhead, and heightened compliance risks due to manual interventions and rigid scheduling mechanisms that cannot adapt to evolving business needs. In this post, we walk through how Stifel Financial Corp, in collaboration with AWS ProServe, has addressed these challenges by building a modular, event-driven orchestration solution using AWS native services that enables precise triggering of data pipelines based on dependency satisfaction, supporting near real-time responsiveness and cross-domain coordination.",

Customers can now find out the exact addresses in use when sending emails through DIP-M pools to mailbox providers. Customers can also see Microsoft Smart Network Data Services (SNDS) metrics for these IP addresses, giving them more insight into their sending reputation with Microsoft mailbox providers. This gives customers more transparency into the IP activities in DIP-M pools.\n  Previously, customers could configure DIP-M pools to perform automatic IP allocation and warm-up in response to changes in email sending volumes. This reduced the operational overhead of managing dedicated sending channels, but customers could not easily see which IP addresses were in use by DIP-M pools. This also made it difficult to find SNDS feedback, which customers use to improve their reputation. Now, customers can see the IPs in DIP-M pools through the console, CLI, or SES API. SES also automatically creates CloudWatch Metrics for SNDS information on each IP address, which customers can access through the CloudWatch console or APIs.

This feature introduces a new patch state called \"AvailableSecurityUpdate\" that reports security patches of all severity levels that are available to install on Windows instances but do not meet the approval rules in your patch baseline.\n  As organizations grow, administrators need to maintain secure systems while controlling when patches are applied. The security updates notification helps prevent situations where customers could unintentionally leave instances unpatched when using features like ApprovalDelay with large values. By default, instances with available security updates are marked as Non-Compliant, providing a clear signal that security patches require attention. Customers can also configure this behavior through their patch baseline settings to maintain existing compliance reporting if preferred.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Systems Manager is available. To get started with security updates notification for Windows patching compliance, visit the AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager console. For more information about this feature, refer to our user documentation or update your patch baseline with the details here. There are no additional charges for using this feature beyond standard AWS Systems Manager pricing.",

Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
