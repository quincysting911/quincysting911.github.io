      "description": "Amazon Route 53 Domains now supports registration and management of ten new top-level domains (TLDs): .ai, .nz, .shop, .bot, .moi, .spot, .free, .deal, .now, and .hot. This expansion enhances Route 53's capabilities as a domain registration and DNS management service, offering customers more options to establish their online presence. With these additions, businesses and individuals can now leverage domain names tailored to specific industries, regions, or purposes directly through Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n  The new TLDs cater to various use cases. To name a few, the .ai domain, originally for Anguilla, has become popular among artificial intelligence companies. E-commerce sites can utilize .shop for their online storefronts. The .bot domain suits chatbot and AI-related services. The .now domain works well for time-sensitive services and instant delivery platforms. Users can register these domains through the Route 53 console, AWS CLI, or SDKs, enjoying integrated DNS management and automatic renewal features. This seamless integration allows for efficient domain administration alongside existing Route 53 hosted zones and DNS records.\n  To learn more about Amazon Route 53 Domains and start registering new domains, visit the Amazon Route 53 page. Domain registration pricing varies by TLD. Visit the pricing page for detailed pricing information.",

      "description": "EC2 Auto Scaling is introducing a new policy condition key autoscaling:ForceDelete. This condition key is used with the DeleteAutoScalingGroup action to control whether the ForceDelete parameter can be used during deletion, which determines if an Auto Scaling group (ASG) can be deleted while it still contains running instances. You can use this condition key in IAM policies to restrict deletion permissions. This provides a safety measure to prevent accidental deletion of ASGs that still have running instances.\n  Furthermore, EC2 Auto Scaling now offers deletion protection at the group level. The new deletion-protection configuration can be set either when you create your ASGs or update them. This new feature lets you set enhanced controls based on your workload's criticality, with multiple protection levels available to safeguard against accidental deletions and help maintain application availability.\n  Combining the autoscaling:ForceDelete condition key with deletion protection at the group level provides a layered defense against unwanted ASG termination by allowing you to both restrict IAM permissions for force-delete operations and set enhanced protection controls directly on critical ASGs.\n  The features now available in all AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To get started, visit the EC2 Auto Scaling console or refer to our technical documentation for deletion protection and policy condition keys for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.",

Once a replica is set up, Amazon RDS for Oracle manages asynchronous physical replication between primary and replica database instances using Oracle Data Guard.\n \nAmazon RDS for Oracle read replicas use Oracle Data Guard. Using mounted mode replicas require an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license, and using read-only mode replicas require additional Oracle Active Data Guard licenses.

The Reserved tier provides the ability to reserve prioritized compute capacity, keeping service levels predictable for your mission critical applications. It also includes the flexibility to allocate different input and output tokens-per-minute capacities to match the exact requirements of your workload and control cost. This is particularly valuable because many workloads have asymmetric token usage patterns. For instance, summarization tasks consume many input tokens but generate fewer output tokens, while content generation applications require less input and more output capacity. When your application needs more tokens-per-minute capacity than what you reserved , the service automatically overflows to the pay-as-you-go Standard tier, ensuring uninterrupted operations. The Reserved tier is available today for Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 in AWS GovCloud (US-West). Customers can reserve capacity for 1 month or 3 month duration. Customers pay a fixed price per 1K tokens-per-minute and are billed monthly. Amazon Bedrock Reserved Tier is available for customers in AWS GovCloud (US-West) via GOV-CRIS cross-region profile.\n  With the expansion of the Reserved service tier, Amazon Bedrock continues to provide more choice to customers, helping them develop, scale, and deploy applications and agents that improve productivity and customer experiences while balancing performance and cost requirements.\n  For more information about the AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Reserved tier is available, refer to the Documentation. To get access to the Reserved tier, please contact your AWS account team.",

IS’s orchestration and fan-out mechanisms have been re-architected to enable customers to track AWS tagging events, allowing the product to more intelligently sequence and distribute scheduling operations - improving scaling performance and addressing cost-scaling concerns. The product now enables distributed cloud engineer personas to perform self-service troubleshooting in their spoke accounts through informational tags applied to their resources without relying on a central cloud administrator. In addition, an optional Insufficient Capacity Error Retry flow has been added to automatically retry failed start actions using alternate instance types when EC2 encounters insufficient capacity errors, ensuring workloads start reliably even in constrained Availability Zones or regions. Lastly, Instance Scheduler on AWS now automatically creates a dedicated EventBus for scheduling-related events, streamlining integrations and automation workflows.\n \nThis update improves Instance Scheduler’s scalability, reduces operational overhead, and increases workload reliability across complex customer environments. You can accelerate issue resolution and boost operational efficiency by empowering distributed cloud engineers to troubleshoot independently. You can enhance overall workload resilience by improving handling of EC2 capacity shortages and simplify integrations by streamlining event routing through the new EventBus to support more extensible automation workflows.\n \nTo learn more about Instance Scheduler, visit the Product Page or contact your AWS account team.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon Bedrock announces the expansion of the Reserved service tier designed for workloads requiring predictable performance and guaranteed tokens-per-minute capacity. The Reserved tier provides the ability to reserve prioritized compute capacity, keeping service levels predictable for your mission critical applications. It also includes the flexibility to allocate different input and output tokens-per-minute capacities to match the exact requirements of your workload and control cost. This is particularly valuable because many workloads have asymmetric token usage patterns. For instance, summarization tasks consume many input tokens but generate fewer output tokens, while content generation applications require less input and more output capacity. When your application needs more tokens-per-minute capacity than what you reserved , the service automatically overflows to the pay-as-you-go Standard tier, ensuring uninterrupted operations. The Reserved tier and is available today for Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Haiku 4.5. Customers can reserve capacity for 1 month or 3 month duration. Customers pay a fixed price per 1K tokens-per-minute and are billed monthly.\n  With the expansion of the Reserved service tier, Amazon Bedrock continues to provide more choice to customers, helping them develop, scale, and deploy applications and agents that improve productivity and customer experiences while balancing performance and cost requirements.\n  For more information about the AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Reserved tier is available, refer to the Documentation.

Instead of cleaning up frames one by one, you can fix a handful of representative frames and CopyCat will automatically apply these changes to the rest of your footage, saving you significant amounts of valuable time. With this integration, you can now train models by submitting CopyCat training jobs directly to your Deadline Cloud render farm. This gives you the ability to scale and run multiple training workloads in parallel while freeing up your artist workstations for creative work. You can monitor and track training jobs alongside other render jobs through the Deadline Cloud interface for one simple view across an entire project.\n  AWS Deadline Cloud with Nuke CopyCat integration is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Deadline Cloud is supported.

      "description": "AWS Lambda now supports cross-account access for Amazon DynamoDB Streams event-source mappings (ESMs), enabling you to trigger Lambda functions in one account from DynamoDB Streams in another account.\n  Customers build event-driven applications using Lambda's fully-managed DynamoDB Streams ESMs, which poll change events from DynamoDB tables and trigger your Lambda functions. Organizations implementing multi-account architectures—whether to centralize event processing or share events with partner teams—previously needed to build complex data replication solutions to share data across accounts, which added operational overhead. With this launch, you can now provide cross-account access to your DynamoDB Streams to trigger Lambda functions in another account. By setting a resource-based policy on your DynamoDB stream, you can enable a Lambda function in one account to access a DynamoDB stream in another account. This capability allows you to simplify your streaming applications across accounts without the overhead of replication solutions in each account.\n  This feature is generally available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. You can enable cross-account Lambda triggers by creating resource-based policies for your DynamoDB Streams using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS APIs.

      "description": "Amazon Redshift Serverless introduces queue-based query resource management. You can create dedicated query queues with customized monitoring rules for different workloads. This feature provides granular control over resource usage. Queues let you set metrics-based predicates and automated responses. For example, you can configure rules to automatically abort queries that exceed time limits or consume too many resources.\n  Previously, Query Monitoring Rules (QMR) were applied only at the Redshift Serverless workgroup level, affecting all queries run in this workgroup uniformly. The new queue-based approach lets you create queues with distinct monitoring rules. You can assign these queues to specific user roles and query groups. Each queue operates independently, with rules affecting only the queries within that queue. The available monitoring metrics can be found in Query monitoring metrics for Amazon Redshift Serverless.\n  This feature is available in all AWS regions that support Amazon Redshift Serverless. You can manage QMR with queues through the AWS Console and Redshift APIs.\n  For implementation details, see the documentation in the Amazon Redshift management guide.",

      "description": "Amazon EMR Serverless now supports job run-level cost allocation that provides better visibility into charges for individual job runs by allowing you to configure granular billing attribution at the individual job run level. You can get granular cost visibility by filtering and tracking costs in AWS Cost Explorer and Cost and Usage Reports by specific job run IDs and cost allocation tags associated with job runs.\n  Amazon EMR Serverless is a deployment option in Amazon EMR that makes it simple for data engineers and data scientists to run open-source big data analytics frameworks without configuring, managing, and scaling clusters or servers. Previously, you could assign cost allocation tags to EMR Serverless applications, with cost attribution limited to the application level. With job run-level cost allocation, now you can assign cost allocation tags to each job run, enabling fine-grained billing attribution at the individual job run level. Cost allocation tags at the job run level also allow you to track costs by domains within a single application. For example, a single application could support jobs for finance and marketing domains, allowing you to track costs separately for each domain. Tracking costs for individual job runs makes it easier to conduct benchmarks that assess the costs of each job run as well as focus cost optimization efforts more precisely, allowing deeper insights into resource utilization and spending patterns across different jobs and domains.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon EMR Serverless is available including AWS GovCloud (US) and China regions.

Quick is Amazon's new AI-powered workspace and agentic teammate that helps organizations get answers from their business data and move quickly from insights to action. As organizations navigate newly adopted AI agents and work with existing enterprise tools for CRM, support, collaboration, and more, users face fragmented experiences. Users are forced to switch between different interfaces, repeat context, and manually stitch together outputs. Quick enables users to work with third-party agents and enterprise tools from a single interface, eliminating the wasted time and cognitive load of constantly switching between applications.\n  With Quick, business users can now invoke specialized agents from Box, Canva, and PagerDuty to accomplish chat and automation tasks. For example, you can pull incident insights from PagerDuty, generate a presentation in Canva, and query documents stored in Box - all directly from Quick.

The new Quickstart setup, reduces the number of steps required to set up an Client VPN endpoint. You can now easily set up Client VPN endpoints with pre-defined default configurations, requiring only three key inputs: IPv4 CIDR, server certificate ARN, and subnet selection. For example, development teams in large organizations who use Client VPN for remote access to their VPC resources for quick testing can now create endpoints quickly with the new simplified setup process.\n  The Quickstart method is available alongside the existing Standard Setup option, giving you the flexibility to choose the approach that best fits your deployment needs. Additionally, when you create a VPC, the Client VPN Quickstart workflow is automatically suggested as a follow up step. Once endpoint creation is complete, you can immediately download the client configuration file to connect using your VPN client. You can later modify and enhance your endpoint configuration using the Client VPN standard console or API as your usage patterns evolve. This enhancement is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where AWS Client VPN is generally available.\n  To learn more about Client VPN:\n  \n \n \nVisit the AWS Client VPN product page\n \n \nRead the AWS Client VPN documentation",

With tmpfs, you can now create memory‑backed file systems for your containerized workloads without writing this data to task storage.\n  tmpfs mounts provide a temporary file system that is backed by memory and exposed inside the container at a path you choose. This is ideal for performance‑sensitive workloads that need fast access to scratch files, caches, or temporary working sets, and for security‑sensitive data such as short‑lived secrets or credentials, because the data does not persist after the task stops. tmpfs also lets you keep the container root file system read‑only using the readonlyRootFilesystem setting while still allowing applications to write to specific in‑memory directories.\n  To get started, update your task definition so that the container definitions include a linuxParameters block with one or more tmpfs entries. For each tmpfs mount, specify the containerPath, size, and optional mountOptions. You can register or update task definitions using the Amazon ECS console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS CDK.
