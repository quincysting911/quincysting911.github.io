      "description": "Amazon Lex now allows you to use Large Language Models (LLMs) as the primary option to understand customer intent across voice and chat interactions. With this capability, your voice and chat bots can better understand customer requests, handle complex utterances, maintain accuracy despite spelling errors, and extract key information from verbose inputs. When customer intent is unclear, bots can intelligently ask follow-up questions to fulfill requests accurately. For example, when a customer says “I need help with my flight,” the LLM automatically clarifies whether the customer wants to check their flight status, upgrade their flight, or change their flight.\n  This feature is available in all AWS commercial regions where Amazon Connect and Lex operate.

      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Service launches Agentic Search, transforming how users interact with their data through intelligent, agent-driven search. Agentic Search introduces an intelligent agent-driven system that understands user intent, orchestrates the right set of tools, generates OpenSearch DSL (domain-specific language) queries, and provides transparent summaries of its decision-making process through a simple 'agentic' query clause and natural language search terms.\n  Agentic Search automates OpenSearch query planning and execution, eliminating the need for complex search syntax. Users can ask questions in natural language like \"Find red cars under $30,000\" or \"Show last quarter's sales trends.\" The agent interprets intent, applies optimal search strategies, and delivers results while explaining its reasoning process. The feature provides two agent types: conversational agents, which handle complex interactions with the ability to store conversations in memory, and flow agents for efficient query processing. The built-in QueryPlanningTool uses large language models (LLMs) to create DSL queries, making search accessible regardless of technical expertise. Users can manage Agentic Search through APIs or OpenSearch Dashboards to configure and modify agents. Agentic Search’s advanced settings allow you to connect with external MCP servers and use custom search templates.\n  Support for agentic search is available for OpenSearch Service version 3.3 and later in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where OpenSearch Service is available. See here for a full listing of our Regions.\n  Build agents and run agentic searches using the new Agentic Search use case available in the AI Search Flows plugin.

On-Demand Capacity Reservations (ODCRs) help you reserve compute capacity in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. When ODCRs are not in use, you can now make them temporarily available as interruptible ODCRs, enabling other workloads within your organization to utilize them while preserving your ability to reclaim the capacity for critical operations.\n  By repurposing unused capacity as interruptible ODCRs, workloads suitable for flexible, fault-tolerant operations—such as batch processing, data analysis, and machine learning training can benefit from temporarily available capacity. Reservation owners can reclaim their capacity at any time, while consumers of interruptible ODCRs will receive an interruption notice before termination to allow for graceful shutdown or checkpointing before.\n  Interruptible ODCRs are now available at no additional cost to all Capacity Reservations customers. Refer to the AWS Capabilities by Region website for the feature's regional availability. CloudFormation support will be coming soon.

Customers are adopting multi-warehouse architectures to scale and isolate workloads and are looking for simplified, consistent permissions management across warehouses. With Redshift federated permissions, you define data permissions once from any Redshift warehouse and automatically enforce them across all warehouses in the account.\n  Amazon Redshift warehouses with federated permissions are auto-mounted in every Redshift warehouse, and you can use existing workforce identities with AWS IAM Identity Center or use existing IAM roles to query data across warehouses. Regardless of which warehouse is used for querying, row-level, column-level, and masking controls always apply automatically, delivering fine-grained access compliance. You can get started by registering a Redshift Serverless namespace or Redshift provisioned cluster with AWS Glue Data Catalog and start querying across warehouses using Redshift Query Editor V2, or any supported SQL client. You get horizontal scalability with multiple warehouses by allowing you to add new warehouses without increasing governance complexity, as new warehouses automatically enforce permission policies and analysts immediately see all databases from registered warehouses.\n  Amazon Redshift federated permissions is available at no additional cost in supported AWS regions.

All parameters are customizable to meet your specific needs.\n  Additionally, advanced versioning and aliasing capabilities allow you to manage module updates more seamlessly. You can create immutable version snapshots and map aliases to specific versions. When you update an alias to point to a new version, all flows using that module automatically reference the updated version. These new features make flow modules more powerful and reusable, allowing you to build and maintain flows more efficiently.\n  To learn more about these feature, see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.

The new Flexible Cost Allocation (FCA) feature provides more versatile cost allocation options through a central metering policy. Using FCA metering policy, you can choose to allocate all of your Transit Gateway data processing and data transfer usage to the source attachment account, the destination attachment account, or the central Transit Gateway account. FCA metering policies can be configured at an attachment-level or individual flow-level granularity. FCA also supports middle-box deployment models enabling you to allocate data processing usage on middle-box appliances such as AWS Network Firewall to the original source or destination attachment owners. This flexibility allows you to implement multiple cost allocation models on a single Transit Gateway, accommodating various chargeback scenarios within your AWS network infrastructure.\n  Flexible Cost Allocation is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Transit Gateway is available. You can enable these features using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS Software Development Kit (SDK). There is no additional charge for using FCA on Transit Gateway. For more information, see the Transit Gateway documentation pages.",

You can now configure DPU settings at the workgroup or query level to balance cost efficiency, concurrency, and query-level performance needs.\n  Capacity Reservations provides dedicated serverless processing capacity for your Athena queries. Capacity is measured in DPUs, and queries consume DPUs based on their complexity. Now you can set explicit DPU values for each query—ensuring small queries use only what they need while guaranteeing critical queries get sufficient resources for fast execution. The Athena console and API now return per-query DPU usage, helping you understand DPU usage and determine your capacity needs. These updates help you control per-query capacity usage, control query concurrency, reduce costs by eliminating over-provisioning, and deliver consistent performance for business-critical workloads.\n  Cost and performance controls are available today in AWS Regions where Capacity Reservations is supported.
