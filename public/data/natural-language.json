      "title": "Amazon ECS now supports built-in Linear and Canary deployments",
      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) announces support for linear and canary deployment strategies, giving you more flexibility and control when deploying containerized applications. These new strategies complement ECS built-in blue/green deployments, enabling you to choose the traffic shifting approach that best matches your application's risk profile and validation requirements.\n \nWith linear deployments, you can gradually shift traffic from your current service revision to the new revision in equal percentage increments over a specified time period. You configure the step percentage (for example, 10%) to control how much traffic shifts at each increment, and set a step bake time to wait between each traffic shift for monitoring and validation. This allows you to validate your new application version at multiple stages with increasing amounts of production traffic. With canary deployments, you can route a small percentage of production traffic to your new service revision while the majority of traffic remains on the current stable version. You set a canary bake time to monitor the new revision's performance, after which Amazon ECS shifts the remaining traffic to the new revision. Both strategies support a deployment bake time that waits after all production traffic has shifted to the new revision before terminating the old revision, enabling quick rollback without downtime if issues are detected. You can configure deployment lifecycle hooks to perform custom validation steps, and use Amazon CloudWatch alarms to automatically detect failures and trigger rollbacks.\n \nThe feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon ECS is available. You can use linear and canary deployment strategies for new and existing Amazon ECS services that use Application Load Balancer (ALB) or ECS Service Connect, using the Console, SDK, CLI, CloudFormation, CDK, and Terraform. To learn more, see our documentation on Amazon ECS linear deployments and Amazon ECS canary deployments.",

      "description": "Today, AWS Clean Rooms announces support for advanced configurations to improve the performance of Spark SQL queries. This launch enables you to customize Spark properties and compute sizes for SQL queries at runtime, offering increased flexibility to meet your performance, scale, and cost requirements. \n  With AWS Clean Rooms, you can configure Spark properties—such as shuffle partition settings for parallel processing and autoBroadcastJoinThreshold for optimizing join operations—to help you better control the behavior and tuning of SQL queries in a Clean Rooms collaboration. Additionally, you can choose to cache an existing table’s data containing results from a SQL query or create and cache a new table, which help improve the performance and reduce costs for complex queries using large datasets. For example, an advertiser running lift analysis on their advertising campaigns can specify a custom number of workers for an instance type and configure Spark properties—without editing their SQL query—to optimize costs.\n  With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development. For more information about the AWS Regions where AWS Clean Rooms is available, see the AWS Regions table. To learn more about collaborating with AWS Clean Rooms, visit AWS Clean Rooms.",

This new feature addresses the challenge many customers face when developing custom scripts for basic endpoint monitoring, which often lack the depth needed for thorough synthetic testing across various check types like HTTP endpoints with different authentication methods, DNS record validation, SSL certificate monitoring, and TCP port checks.\n  With multi-check blueprints, customers can now bundle up to 10 different monitoring steps, one step per endpoint, in a single canary, making API monitoring more cost-effective and easier to implement. The solution provides built-in support for complex assertions on response codes, latency, headers, and body content, along with seamless integration with AWS Secrets Manager for secure credential handling. Customers benefit from detailed step-by-step results and debugging capabilities through the existing CloudWatch Synthetics console, significantly simplifying the process of implementing comprehensive API monitoring compared to writing individual custom canaries for each check. This feature streamlines monitoring workflows, reduces costs, and enhances the overall efficiency of synthetic monitoring setups.\n  Multi-check blueprints are available in all commercial AWS regions where Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics is offered. For pricing details, see Amazon CloudWatch pricing. To learn more about multi-check blueprints and how to get started, see the CloudWatch Synthetics Canaries Blueprints documentation.",

      "description": "Stifel Financial Corp, a diversified financial services holding company is expanding its data landscape that requires an orchestration solution capable of managing increasingly complex data pipeline operations across multiple business domains. Traditional time-based scheduling systems fall short in addressing the dynamic interdependencies between data products, requires event-driven orchestration. Key challenges include coordinating cross-domain dependencies, maintaining data consistency across business units, meeting stringent SLAs, and scaling effectively as data volumes grow. Without a flexible orchestration solution, these issues can lead to delayed business operations and insights, increased operational overhead, and heightened compliance risks due to manual interventions and rigid scheduling mechanisms that cannot adapt to evolving business needs. In this post, we walk through how Stifel Financial Corp, in collaboration with AWS ProServe, has addressed these challenges by building a modular, event-driven orchestration solution using AWS native services that enables precise triggering of data pipelines based on dependency satisfaction, supporting near real-time responsiveness and cross-domain coordination.",
