This release also expands regional availability to include four additional AWS commercial Regions.\n  Research and Engineering Studio on AWS is an open source solution that provides a web-based portal for administrators to create and manage secure cloud-based research and engineering environments. RES enables scientists and engineers to access powerful Windows and Linux virtual desktops with pre-installed applications and shared resources, without requiring cloud expertise.\n  Version 2025.09 adds support for Amazon EC2 g6f instances, enabling GPU fractionalization for more efficient resource utilization in graphics-intensive workloads. The release also introduces Systems Manager Parameter Alias support for AMI IDs, simplifying the management of project-specific images, and enables integration with existing Amazon Cognito user pools for streamlined authentication setup during deployment. Administrators can now also customize CIDR ranges in the AWS CloudFormation external resources template for better network planning and integration with existing resources.\n  This release expands regional availability to include Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Middle East (UAE), and South America (São Paulo).

      "description": "Amazon Lex now provides support for confirmation and currency slot types in 10 additional languages: Portuguese, Catalan, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, and Korean. Built-in slots help you build more natural and efficient conversations by understanding synonyms of what you user says and resolving those inputs to a standard format. The confirmation slot helps understand various expressions of user acknowledgement and converts them into ‘Yes’, ‘No’, “Don’t know’‘, or ‘Maybe’. The currency slot helps identify currency and represents the input in a structured way. For example, when a user says “nope” or “absolutely not”, the confirmation slot resolves to ‘No’ or when the user says “1 dollar’, the currency slot resolves it to ”USD 1.00“. These built-in slots help you build more natural and efficient conversational experiences.\n  This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon Lex operates. To learn more about these features, visit Amazon Lex documentation or to learn how Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex deliver cloud-based conversational AI experiences for contact centers, please visit the Amazon Connect website.",

You can download Corretto 25 for Linux, Windows, and macOS from our downloads page.\n  Amazon Corretto 25 new features include:\n  \n \n \nTwo features that were initially released as experimental in JDK 24 are now LTS production-ready in JDK 25:\n Compact Object Headers: designed to lower heap memory usage by shrinking object headers from 96-128 bits down to 64 bits.\n Generational Shenandoah GC: engineered to provide sustainable throughput and lower p99 pause times or similar pause times with a smaller heap and reduced CPU usage.\n \n \nAhead-of-Time (AOT) Caching: designed to improve cold-start and warm-up time by reusing pre-parsed pre-linked classes and compilation profiles between training and production runs.\n \n \nLanguage improvements: primitive types in patterns, flexible constructors, module‑wide imports, compact source files, scoped values for thread-local variables, stable values for immutable data, all designed to cut boilerplate, keep everyday code shorter and safer.\n \n \nObservability: JDK Flight Recorder gains CPU‑time sampling, cooperative sampling and method‑trace events for low‑overhead production profiling.\n \n \nStructured Concurrency: designed to provide coordinated task management, allowing related tasks fail or finish together.\n \n \nVector API: developed to provide computations that compile to optimal vector instructions on supported CPUs.\n \n \nVirtual Thread pinning improvements: reduces thread pinning in synchronized blocks for better scalability.\n \n \nA detailed description of these features can be found on the OpenJDK 25 Project page. Amazon Corretto 25 is distributed by Amazon under an open source license and will be supported through October 2032.",

      "description": "Today AWS announced custom time periods for AWS Budgets, a new capability that lets you create budgets with flexible start and end dates. This enhancement allows you to define budget periods that align with your organization's specific needs, moving beyond traditional calendar-based periods like monthly, quarterly, or annual budgets.\n  Custom time periods help you accurately monitor costs for projects with specific duration and funding limits. For example, if you have a three-month development project starting mid-month, you can create a single budget for that exact time frame and receive alerts when spending approaches your thresholds. This eliminates the need to calculate and split your project budget across multiple calendar months or maintain separate spreadsheets to track time-bound initiatives.\n  Custom time periods in AWS Budgets is available today in all AWS commercial Regions, except the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and the China Regions.\n  To learn more about custom time periods in AWS Budgets, see Managing your costs with AWS Budgets in the AWS Billing User Guide.",
