Instead of manually defining valid options — such as applicable defect types based on product category — admins can upload a file to define these relationships at scale, reducing onboarding effort and configuration time.\n  Amazon Connect Cases is available in the following AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (London), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Africa (Cape Town) AWS regions.

      "title": "AWS Network Firewall announces new price reductions",
      "description": "AWS Network Firewall has introduced two pricing improvements for customers. The service has added the hourly and data processing discounts on NAT Gateways that are service-chained with Network Firewall secondary endpoints. Additionally, AWS Network Firewall has removed additional data processing charges for Advanced Inspection, which enables Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection of encrypted network traffic.\n \nPreviously, NAT Gateway discounts were limited to primary Network Firewall endpoints, and customers paid additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection for TLS inspection in select AWS regions. With these improvements, the NAT Gateway discounts now apply when service-chained with both primary and secondary firewall endpoints. Customers also no longer pay the additional data processing charge for Advanced Inspection that ranged from $0.001/GB to $0.009/GB in 13 AWS regions: Middle East (Bahrain), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), EU (Milan), South America (São Paulo), US West (N. California), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Melbourne).\n \nThese changes help to reduce costs for architectures that use Network Firewall's multiple VPC endpoint capability and TLS inspection features. Multiple VPC endpoints allow you to connect 50 VPCs per Availability Zone to a single Network Firewall, helping to reduce operational complexity and lower costs as you protect more VPCs. By removing additional data processing charges when using Advanced Inspection, customers can now implement TLS inspection more cost-effectively across their network security architecture.\n \nThese pricing improvements are available in all AWS regions where Network Firewall is offered and are applied automatically to eligible configurations. No action is required from customers.\n \nTo learn more, see AWS Network Firewall pricing and the AWS Network Firewall service documentation.",

      "description": "AWS IAM Identity Center now supports Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) through new dual-stack endpoints. Customers can now connect to AWS IAM Identity Center using IPv6, IPv4, or dual-stack clients. The existing AWS IAM Identity Center endpoints supporting IPv4 remain available for backward compatibility.\n  IAM Identity Center allows customers to enable workforce access to AWS managed applications and AWS accounts. When your client, such as a browsers or an application, makes a request to a dual-stack endpoint, the endpoint resolves to an IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending on the protocol used by your network and client. This launch helps you meet IPv6 compliance requirements, and minimize the need for complex NAT infrastructure.\n  IPv6 support is available in all AWS Regions where IAM Identity Center is available, except the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and the Taipei Region.

      "description": "AWS is announcing flexible billing for Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances, adding monthly flat-rate pricing alongside existing hourly billing. Customers can now choose the optimal pricing model based on their end user usage patterns. Monthly billing is ideal for predictable full-time desktops and hourly billing is ideal for variable usage patterns. Both options are pay-as-you-go with no long-term commitments.\n  Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances simplifies virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) migrations with highly customizable instance configurations. WorkSpaces Core managed instances provisions resources in your AWS account, handling infrastructure lifecycle management for both persistent and non-persistent workloads. Monthly pricing delivers savings vs hourly billing at always-on utilization, optimized for real-world VDI use cases.\n  With flexible billing, customers benefit from predictable costs for persistent desktop workloads and the flexibility to mix hourly and monthly billing within the same deployment. VDI partners utilizing WorkSpaces Core managed instances including Citrix, Workspot, Dizzion, and Leostream can now integrate with new WorkSpaces API billing features to enable the monthly billing option when instances are created. Hourly billing remains the default billing option for managed instances.\n  In addition, starting today, hourly utility rates for WorkSpaces Core managed instances will now be combined and billed by Amazon WorkSpaces to simplify pricing. Previously, hourly rates were split between Amazon EC2 and Amazon WorkSpaces on customer bills. There is no change to the effective rates for on-demand hourly usage of WorkSpaces Core Managed Instances with this announcement.\n  To learn more about Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances flexible billing, visit the WorkSpaces for VDI partners pricing page. For more information, see the WorkSpaces for VDI partners product page. For technical documentation, see the Amazon WorkSpaces Core Documentation.",

      "description": "Today, we're announcing that Amazon Elastic VMware Service (Amazon EVS) now supports the ability to deploy multiple VMware NSX Tier-0 Gateways within VMware Software-Defined Data Centers (SDDC), enabling enhanced network segmentation and more flexible routing configurations.\n  Multiple NSX Tier-0 Gateways allow for better performance and scale by distributing network traffic across multiple NSX Edge Clusters. This latest enhancement enables improved network segmentation, allowing you to isolate different workload environments and maintain distinct security policies for each gateway. You can also use multiple gateways to create separate test environments for validating network configurations and performing gateway upgrades with minimal impact to production workloads. This architecture flexibility helps you align your network topology with specific business requirements while maintaining operational efficiency in running your VMware workloads on AWS with Amazon EVS. \n  To learn more about this newest enhancement, read this re:Post article that walks you through the process of deploying multiple NSX Edge Clusters within your EVS environment.

      "description": "Starting today, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) C8i and C8i-flex instances are available in the Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Europe (Frankfurt) regions. These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors, available only on AWS, delivering the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud. These C8i and C8i-flex instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver up to 20% higher performance than C7i and C7i-flex instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. The C8i and C8i-flex are up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models, and 35% faster for Memcached stores compared to C7i and C7i-flex.\n  C8i-flex are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of compute intensive workloads like web and application servers, databases, caches, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, and enterprise applications. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.\n  C8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. C8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal sizes and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications.\n  To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console. Customers can purchase these instances via Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances. For more information about the new C8i and C8i-flex instances visit the AWS News blog.",
