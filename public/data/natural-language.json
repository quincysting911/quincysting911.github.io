      "title": "AWS announces enhanced custom line item controls for AWS Billing Conductor",
      "description": "Starting today, AWS Billing Conductor customers gain greater flexibility when using custom line items.\n  Customers can now create service-specific custom line items scoped at either one AWS service or to a set of selected AWS service and can choose how these line items are presented in the pro forma billing artifacts, such as Bills Page, Cost Explorer and Cost and Usage Records.\n  These enhancements enable customers to create more precise and tailored charge-back and re-billing strategies that better reflect their pricing structures and improve the traceability experience for pro forma users. Customers can use this functionality to apply percentage discounts on Saving Plans fees or allocate shared flat support charges under AWS Support service. Service specific custom line items are available for standard billing group regardless of the type of pricing plan selected, and for billing-transfer billing groups exclusively when customer-managed pricing plans are selected.\n  To start, use AWS Billing Conductor console or APIs, create a custom line item and specify the cost reference value (one or multiple AWS services) and the display setting options (itemized or consolidated under your service of choice). To learn more about custom line items visit AWS Billing Conductor documentation.\n  This feature is available now in all AWS commercial Regions, excluding AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, and AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD.",

      "title": "EC2 Auto Scaling now offers a synchronous API to launch instances inside an Auto Scaling group",
      "description": "Today, EC2 Auto Scaling is launching a new API, LaunchInstances, which gives customers more control and flexibility over how EC2 Auto Scaling provisions instances while providing instant feedback on capacity availability.\n  Customers use EC2 Auto Scaling for automated fleet management. With scaling policies, EC2 Auto Scaling can automatically add instances when demand spikes and remove them when traffic drops, ensuring customers' applications always have the right amount of compute. EC2 Auto Scaling also offers the ability to monitor and replace unhealthy instances. In certain use cases, customers may want to specify exactly where EC2 Auto Scaling should launch additional instances and need immediate feedback on capacity availability. The new LaunchInstances API allows customers to precisely control where instances are launched by specifying an override for any Availability Zone and/or subnet in an Auto Scaling group, while providing immediate feedback on capacity availability. This synchronous operation gives customers real-time insight into scaling operations, enabling them to quickly implement alternative strategies if needed. For additional flexibility, the API includes optional asynchronous retries to help reach the desired capacity.\n  This feature is now available in all AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, at no additional cost beyond standard EC2 and EBS usage. To get started, visit the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs. To learn more about this feature, visit the AWS documentation.",

      "description": "Starting today, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) C8i and C8i-flex instances are available in the Asia Pacific (Singapore) region. These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors, available only on AWS, delivering the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud. These C8i and C8i-flex instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver up to 20% higher performance than C7i and C7i-flex instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. The C8i and C8i-flex are up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models, and 35% faster for Memcached stores compared to C7i and C7i-flex.\n  C8i-flex are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of compute intensive workloads like web and application servers, databases, caches, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, and enterprise applications. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.\n  C8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. C8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal sizes and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications.\n  To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console. Customers can purchase these instances via Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances. For more information about the new C8i and C8i-flex instances visit the AWS News blog.",
