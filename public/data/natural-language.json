Outposts racks extend AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any on-premises data center or colocation space for a truly consistent hybrid experience.\n \nOrganizations from startups to enterprises and the public sector in and outside of Canada and the US can now order their Outposts racks connected to these two new supported Regions, optimizing for their latency and data residency needs. Outposts allows customers to run workloads that need low-latency access to on-premises systems locally while connecting back to their home Region for application management. Customers can also use Outposts and AWS services to manage and process data that needs to remain on-premises to meet data residency requirements. This regional expansion provides additional flexibility in the AWS Regions that customers’ Outposts can connect to.\n \nTo learn more about second-generation Outposts racks, read this blog post and user guide.

Built-in slots help you build more natural and efficient conversations by understanding synonyms of what you user says and resolving those inputs to a standard format. The confirmation slot helps understand various expressions of user acknowledgement and converts them into ‘Yes’, ‘No’, “Don’t know’‘, or ‘Maybe’. The currency slot helps identify currency and represents the input in a structured way. For example, when a user says “nope” or “absolutely not”, the confirmation slot resolves to ‘No’ or when the user says “1 dollar’, the currency slot resolves it to ”USD 1.00“. These built-in slots help you build more natural and efficient conversational experiences.\n  This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon Lex operates. To learn more about these features, visit Amazon Lex documentation or to learn how Amazon Connect and Amazon Lex deliver cloud-based conversational AI experiences for contact centers, please visit the Amazon Connect website.",

AWS Step Functions is a visual workflow service that enables customers to build distributed applications, automate IT and business processes, and build data and machine learning pipelines using AWS services. This enhancement addresses the growing need for IP addresses as the internet continues to expand, providing a larger address space than the traditional IPv4 format.\n  With IPv6 support, organizations modernizing their applications can now build serverless workflows without being constrained by limited IPv4 address space. The new dual-stack endpoints support both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing IPv4 endpoints. Step Functions also supports IPv6 connectivity through PrivateLink interface Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints, enabling you to access the service privately without traversing the public internet. This enables organizations operating in IPv6 environments to natively integrate with Step Functions without requiring complex translation mechanisms between IPv6 and IPv4.\n  IPv6 support for AWS Step Functions is now generally available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California) as well as AWS GovCloud (US-East), and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, where AWS Step Functions is available.\n  To learn more about IPv6 support on AWS, visit the documentation page.",

This enhancement allows you to define budget periods that align with your organization's specific needs, moving beyond traditional calendar-based periods like monthly, quarterly, or annual budgets.\n  Custom time periods help you accurately monitor costs for projects with specific duration and funding limits. For example, if you have a three-month development project starting mid-month, you can create a single budget for that exact time frame and receive alerts when spending approaches your thresholds. This eliminates the need to calculate and split your project budget across multiple calendar months or maintain separate spreadsheets to track time-bound initiatives.\n  Custom time periods in AWS Budgets is available today in all AWS commercial Regions, except the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and the China Regions.\n  To learn more about custom time periods in AWS Budgets, see Managing your costs with AWS Budgets in the AWS Billing User Guide.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon AppStream 2.0 announces support for Graphics G6 instances with fractionalized GPU sizes, which are built on the EC2 G6 family, designed to cater to graphics applications that need smaller GPU fractions.\n  Graphics G6 instances with fractionalized GPU sizes (G6f and Gr6f) allow users to utilize only the GPU resources they need, rather than provisioning full GPU instances. This approach helps enable better resource optimization through shared GPU capacity, offering flexibility to choose smaller GPU fractions (such as 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8) that align with specific workload requirements. Organizations can benefit from reduced costs by avoiding over-provisioning while maintaining access to GPU capabilities for applications that don't require full GPU power.\n  These new instance types are available in 10 AWS Regions, including US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt, London), Asia Pacific (Tokyo, Mumbai, Sydney), and South America (Sao Paulo). AppStream 2.0 offers pay-as-you-go pricing, see Amazon AppStream 2.0 Pricing for more information.\n  To get started, select an AppStream 2.0 Graphics G6 instances with fractionalized GPU sizes when launching an image builder or creating a new fleet. You can launch Graphics G6 instances with fractionalized GPU sizes using either the AWS management console or the AWS SDK. To learn more, see AppStream 2.0 Instance Families.",

The R8i and R8i-flex instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver 20% better performance than R7i instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. They are up to 30% faster for PostgreSQL databases, up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, and up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models compared to R7i.\n  R8i-flex, our first memory-optimized Flex instances, are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of memory-intensive workloads. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.\n  R8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. R8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications. R8i instances are SAP-certified and deliver 142,100 aSAPS, the highest among all comparable machines in on-premises and cloud environments, delivering exceptional performance for mission-critical SAP workloads.\n  To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console.
