      "description": "Hundreds of thousands of customers build artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) and analytics applications on AWS, frequently transforming data through multiple stages for improved query performance—from raw data to processed datasets to final analytical tables. Data engineers must solve complex problems, including detecting what data has changed in base tables, writing and maintaining transformation […]",

      "title": "AWS Lambda announces durable functions for multi-step applications and AI workflows",
      "description": "AWS Lambda announces durable functions, enabling developers to build reliable multi-step applications and AI workflows within the Lambda developer experience. Durable functions automatically checkpoint progress, suspend execution for up to one year during long-running tasks, and recover from failures - all without requiring you to manage additional infrastructure or write custom state management and error handling code.\n  Customers use Lambda for the simplicity of its event-driven programming model and built-in integrations. While traditional Lambda functions excel at handling single, short-lived tasks, developers building complex multi-step applications, such as order processing, user onboarding, and AI-assisted workflows, previously needed to implement custom state management logic or integrate with external orchestration services. Lambda durable functions address this opportunity by extending the Lambda programming model with new operations like \"steps\" and \"waits\" that let you checkpoint progress and pause execution without incurring compute charges. The service handles state management, error recovery, and efficient pausing and resuming of long-running tasks, allowing you to focus on your core business logic.\n  Lambda durable functions are generally available in US East (Ohio) with support for Python (versions 3.13 and 3.14) and Node.js (versions 22 and 24) runtimes. For the latest region availability, visit the AWS Capabilities by Region page.\n  You can activate durable functions for new Python or Node.js based Lambda functions using the AWS Lambda API, AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS Cloud Formation, AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), AWS SDK, and AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). For more information on durable functions, visit the AWS Lambda Developer Guide and launch blog post. To learn about pricing, visit AWS Lambda pricing.",
