      "description": "AWS IAM Identity Center now supports Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) through new dual-stack endpoints. Customers can now connect to AWS IAM Identity Center using IPv6, IPv4, or dual-stack clients. The existing AWS IAM Identity Center endpoints supporting IPv4 remain available for backward compatibility.\n  IAM Identity Center allows customers to enable workforce access to AWS managed applications and AWS accounts. When your client, such as a browsers or an application, makes a request to a dual-stack endpoint, the endpoint resolves to an IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending on the protocol used by your network and client. This launch helps you meet IPv6 compliance requirements, and minimize the need for complex NAT infrastructure.\n  IPv6 support is available in all AWS Regions where IAM Identity Center is available, except the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and the Taipei Region. To learn more, visit the IAM Identity Center User Guide.",

      "description": "AWS is announcing flexible billing for Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances, adding monthly flat-rate pricing alongside existing hourly billing. Customers can now choose the optimal pricing model based on their end user usage patterns. Monthly billing is ideal for predictable full-time desktops and hourly billing is ideal for variable usage patterns. Both options are pay-as-you-go with no long-term commitments.\n  Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances simplifies virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) migrations with highly customizable instance configurations. WorkSpaces Core managed instances provisions resources in your AWS account, handling infrastructure lifecycle management for both persistent and non-persistent workloads. Monthly pricing delivers savings vs hourly billing at always-on utilization, optimized for real-world VDI use cases.\n  With flexible billing, customers benefit from predictable costs for persistent desktop workloads and the flexibility to mix hourly and monthly billing within the same deployment. VDI partners utilizing WorkSpaces Core managed instances including Citrix, Workspot, Dizzion, and Leostream can now integrate with new WorkSpaces API billing features to enable the monthly billing option when instances are created. Hourly billing remains the default billing option for managed instances.\n  In addition, starting today, hourly utility rates for WorkSpaces Core managed instances will now be combined and billed by Amazon WorkSpaces to simplify pricing. Previously, hourly rates were split between Amazon EC2 and Amazon WorkSpaces on customer bills. There is no change to the effective rates for on-demand hourly usage of WorkSpaces Core Managed Instances with this announcement.\n  To learn more about Amazon WorkSpaces Core managed instances flexible billing, visit the WorkSpaces for VDI partners pricing page. For more information, see the WorkSpaces for VDI partners product page. For technical documentation, see the Amazon WorkSpaces Core Documentation.",

      "description": "Today, we're announcing that Amazon Elastic VMware Service (Amazon EVS) now supports the ability to deploy multiple VMware NSX Tier-0 Gateways within VMware Software-Defined Data Centers (SDDC), enabling enhanced network segmentation and more flexible routing configurations.\n  Multiple NSX Tier-0 Gateways allow for better performance and scale by distributing network traffic across multiple NSX Edge Clusters. This latest enhancement enables improved network segmentation, allowing you to isolate different workload environments and maintain distinct security policies for each gateway. You can also use multiple gateways to create separate test environments for validating network configurations and performing gateway upgrades with minimal impact to production workloads. This architecture flexibility helps you align your network topology with specific business requirements while maintaining operational efficiency in running your VMware workloads on AWS with Amazon EVS. \n  To learn more about this newest enhancement, read this re:Post article that walks you through the process of deploying multiple NSX Edge Clusters within your EVS environment.

      "description": "Starting today, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) C8i and C8i-flex instances are available in the Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Europe (Frankfurt) regions. These instances are powered by custom Intel Xeon 6 processors, available only on AWS, delivering the highest performance and fastest memory bandwidth among comparable Intel processors in the cloud. These C8i and C8i-flex instances offer up to 15% better price-performance, and 2.5x more memory bandwidth compared to previous generation Intel-based instances. They deliver up to 20% higher performance than C7i and C7i-flex instances, with even higher gains for specific workloads. The C8i and C8i-flex are up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models, and 35% faster for Memcached stores compared to C7i and C7i-flex.\n  C8i-flex are the easiest way to get price performance benefits for a majority of compute intensive workloads like web and application servers, databases, caches, Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, and enterprise applications. They offer the most common sizes, from large to 16xlarge, and are a great first choice for applications that don't fully utilize all compute resources.\n  C8i instances are a great choice for all memory-intensive workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. C8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal sizes and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications.\n  To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console. Customers can purchase these instances via Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances. For more information about the new C8i and C8i-flex instances visit the AWS News blog.",

      "description": "Today AWS announced enhanced scheduling orchestration to track AWS tagging events, self-service troubleshooting via informational resource tags, an optional EC2 insufficient-capacity retry flow using alternate instance types, and automatic creation of a dedicated EventBridge bus for scheduling events for Instance Scheduler (IS) on AWS. IS’s orchestration and fan-out mechanisms have been re-architected to enable customers to track AWS tagging events, allowing the product to more intelligently sequence and distribute scheduling operations - improving scaling performance and addressing cost-scaling concerns. The product now enables distributed cloud engineer personas to perform self-service troubleshooting in their spoke accounts through informational tags applied to their resources without relying on a central cloud administrator. In addition, an optional Insufficient Capacity Error Retry flow has been added to automatically retry failed start actions using alternate instance types when EC2 encounters insufficient capacity errors, ensuring workloads start reliably even in constrained Availability Zones or regions. Lastly, Instance Scheduler on AWS now automatically creates a dedicated EventBus for scheduling-related events, streamlining integrations and automation workflows.\n \nThis update improves Instance Scheduler’s scalability, reduces operational overhead, and increases workload reliability across complex customer environments. You can accelerate issue resolution and boost operational efficiency by empowering distributed cloud engineers to troubleshoot independently. You can enhance overall workload resilience by improving handling of EC2 capacity shortages and simplify integrations by streamlining event routing through the new EventBus to support more extensible automation workflows.\n \nTo learn more about Instance Scheduler, visit the Product Page or contact your AWS account team.",
