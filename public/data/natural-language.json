      "title": "Announcing EC2 Image Builder support for Lambda and Step functions",
      "description": "EC2 Image Builder now supports invoking Lambda functions and executing Step Functions state machine through image workflows. These capabilities enable you to incorporate complex, multi-step workflows and custom validation logic into your image creation process, providing greater flexibility and control over how your images are built and validated.\n  Prior to this launch, customers had to write custom code and implement multi-step workarounds to integrate Lambda or Step Functions within image workflows. This was a cumbersome process that was time-consuming to set up, difficult to maintain, and prone to errors. With these new capabilities, you can now seamlessly invoke Lambda functions to execute custom logic or orchestrate Step Functions state machines for complex, multi-step workflows. This native integration allows you to implement use cases such as custom compliance validation, sending custom notifications, multi-stage security testing —all within your Image Builder workflow.\n  These capabilities are available to all customers at no additional costs, in all AWS regions including AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet, AWS China (Ningxia) Region, operated by NWCD, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.\n  You can get started from the EC2 Image Builder Console, CLI, API, CloudFormation, or CDK, and learn more in the EC2 Image Builder documentation.",

This runtime is based on the latest long-term support release of Amazon Corretto, Amazon’s distribution of OpenJDK. You can use Java 25 as both a managed runtime and a container base image, and AWS will automatically apply updates to the managed runtime and base image as they become available.\n  This release brings the latest Java language features to Lambda developers, such as primitive types in patterns, module import declarations, and flexible constructor bodies. It also includes several performance enhancements, such as Ahead-of-Time caches, adjustments to tiered compilation defaults, and removing the patch for the Log4Shell vulnerability from 2021. You can use the full range of AWS deployment tools, including the Lambda console, AWS CLI, AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), CDK, and AWS CloudFormation to deploy and manage serverless applications written in Java 25. The runtime supports Lambda Snap Start (in supported Regions) for fast cold starts. Powertools for AWS Lambda (Java), a developer toolkit to implement serverless best practices and increase developer velocity, also supports Java 25.\n  The Lambda Java 25 runtime is available in all Regions, including AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions.\n  For more information, including guidance on upgrading existing Lambda functions, read our blog post.

This increased bandwidth benefits customers who require high-capacity connections for bandwidth-intensive hybrid applications, big data migrations, and disaster recovery architectures while maintaining traffic encryption between AWS and their remote sites. Customers can also use 5 Gbps VPN connections as a backup or overlay for their high capacity AWS Direct Connect connections.\n  AWS Site-to-Site VPN is a fully managed service that allows you to create a secure connection between your data center or branch office and your AWS resources using IP Security (IPSec) tunnels. Until now, Site-to-Site VPN supported a maximum of 1.25Gbps bandwidth per tunnel and customers had to rely on ECMP (Equal cost multi path) to logically bond multiple tunnels to achieve higher bandwidth. With this launch, customers can now configure their tunnel bandwidth to 5 Gbps, reducing the need to deploy complex protocols such as ECMP while ensuring consistent bandwidth performance.\n  This capability is available in all AWS commercial Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where AWS Site-to-Site VPN is available, except Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Israel (Tel Aviv), Europe (Zurich), Canada West (Calgary), and Middle East (UAE) Regions.

      "description": "Stifel Financial Corp, a diversified financial services holding company is expanding its data landscape that requires an orchestration solution capable of managing increasingly complex data pipeline operations across multiple business domains. Traditional time-based scheduling systems fall short in addressing the dynamic interdependencies between data products, requires event-driven orchestration. Key challenges include coordinating cross-domain dependencies, maintaining data consistency across business units, meeting stringent SLAs, and scaling effectively as data volumes grow. Without a flexible orchestration solution, these issues can lead to delayed business operations and insights, increased operational overhead, and heightened compliance risks due to manual interventions and rigid scheduling mechanisms that cannot adapt to evolving business needs. In this post, we walk through how Stifel Financial Corp, in collaboration with AWS ProServe, has addressed these challenges by building a modular, event-driven orchestration solution using AWS native services that enables precise triggering of data pipelines based on dependency satisfaction, supporting near real-time responsiveness and cross-domain coordination.",
