      "description": "With Amazon Redshift Serverless queue-based Query Monitoring Rules (QMR), administrators can define workload-aware thresholds and automated actions at the queue level—a significant improvement over previous workgroup-level monitoring. You can create dedicated queues for distinct workloads such as BI reporting, ad hoc analysis, or data engineering, then apply queue-specific rules to automatically abort, log, or restrict queries that exceed execution-time or resource-consumption limits. By isolating workloads and enforcing targeted controls, this approach protects mission-critical queries, improves performance predictability, and prevents resource monopolization—all while maintaining the flexibility of a serverless experience. In this post, we discuss how you can implement your workloads with query queues in Redshift Serverless.",

You can save complete data records, including nested JSON objects and lists, and reference specific elements within them, such as a particular order from a list of orders returned in JSON format.\n  Additionally, you can automatically loop through lists of items in your customer service flows, moving through each entry in sequence while tracking the current position in the loop. This allows you to easily access item-level details and present relevant information to end-customers. For example, a travel agency can retrieve all of a customer’s itineraries in a single request and guide the caller through each booking to review or update their reservations. A bank can similarly walk customers through recent transactions one by one using data retrieved securely from its systems. These capabilities reduce the need for repeated calls to your business systems, simplify workflow design, and make it easier to deliver advanced automated experiences that adapt as your business requirements evolve.\n  To learn more about these features, see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.

RES enables scientists and engineers to access powerful Windows and Linux virtual desktops with pre-installed applications and shared resources, without requiring cloud expertise.\n  Tags applied to the CloudFormation stack now propagate to all resources created during RES deployment, making it easier to track costs and manage resources across your organization. Administrators can disable automatic Windows domain joining for hosts, providing flexibility to implement custom domain-join logic when needed. You can now set a default schedule for all new desktop sessions, helping teams standardize session management practices. This version includes several security improvements to help RES deployments meet the NIST 800-223 standard and fixes a bug where some sessions were logged out after 2 minutes when using a custom DNS domain.\n  This release is available in all AWS Regions where RES is available.
