      "title": "Amazon Application Recovery Controller region switch now supports three new capabilities",
      "description": "Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) Region switch allows you to orchestrate the specific steps to switch your multi-Region applications to operate out of another AWS Region and achieve a bounded recovery time in the event of a Regional impairment to your applications. Region switch saves hours of engineering effort and eliminates the operational overhead previously required to complete failover steps, create custom dashboards, and manually gather evidence of a successful recovery for applications across your organization and hosted in multiple AWS accounts. Today, we are announcing three new Region switch capabilities:\n  AWS GovCloud (US) support: ARC Region switch is now generally available in AWS GovCloud (US-East and US-West) Regions.\n  Plan execution reports: Region switch now automatically generates a comprehensive report from each plan execution and saves it to an Amazon S3 bucket of your choice. Each report includes a detailed timeline of events for the recovery operation, resources in scope for the Region switch, alarm states for optional application status alarms, and recovery time objective (RTO) calculations. This eliminates the manual effort previously required to compile evidence and documentation for compliance officers and auditors.\n  DocumentDB global cluster execution blocks: Adding to the catalog of 9 execution blocks, Region switch now supports Amazon DocumentDB global cluster execution blocks for automated multi-Region database recovery. This feature allows you to orchestrate DocumentDB global cluster failover and switchover operations within your Region switch plans.\n  To get started, build a Region switch plan using the ARC console, API, or CLI. See the AWS Regional Services List for availability information. Visit our home page or read the documentation.",

      "description": "AWS Private Certificate Authority (AWS Private CA) now supports Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in China and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. AWS Private CA is a fully managed certificate authority service that makes it easy to create and manage private certificates for your organization without the operational overhead of running your own CA infrastructure. OCSP enables real-time certificate validation, allowing applications to check the revocation status of individual certificates on-demand rather than downloading Certificate Revocation List (CRL) files.\n  With OCSP support, customers in these Regions can implement more efficient certificate validation with minimal bandwidth, typically requiring a few hundred bytes per query, versus downloading large Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) that can be hundreds of kilobytes or larger. This enables real-time revocation checks for use cases such as validating internal microservices communications, implementing zero trust security architectures, and authenticating IoT devices. AWS Private CA fully manages the OCSP responder infrastructure, providing high availability without requiring you to deploy or maintain OCSP servers.\n  OCSP is now also available in the following AWS Regions: China (Beijing), and China (Ningxia), AWS GovCloud (US-East), AWS GovCloud (US-West).\n  To enable OCSP for your certificate authorities, use the AWS Private CA console, AWS CLI, or API. To learn more about OCSP, see Certificate Revocation in the AWS Private CA User Guide. For pricing information, visit the AWS Private CA pricing page.",

This capability provides precise control over when infrastructure updates and task replacements occur, helping prevent disruption to mission-critical workloads during peak business hours.\n  AWS Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. As part of the AWS shared responsibility model, Fargate maintains the underlying infrastructure with periodic platform updates. Fargate automatically retires your tasks for these updates and notifies you about upcoming task retirements via email and the AWS Health Dashboard. By default, tasks are retired 7 days after notification, but you can configure the fargateTaskRetirementWaitPeriod account setting to extend the retirement period to 14 days or initiate immediate retirement (0 days). Previously, you could build automation using the task retirement notification and wait period to perform service updates or task replacements on your own cadence. With today's launch, you can now use the Amazon EC2 event windows interface to define weekly event windows for precise control over the timing of Fargate task retirements. For example, you can schedule task retirements for a mission-critical service that requires high uptime during weekdays by configuring retirements to occur only on weekends.\n  To get started, configure the AWS account setting fargateEventWindows to enabled as a one-time set up. Once enabled, configure Amazon EC2 event window(s) by specifying time ranges, and associate the event window(s) with your ECS tasks by selecting Amazon ECS-managed tags as the association target. Use the aws:ecs:clusterArn tag for targeting your tasks in an ECS cluster, aws:ecs:serviceArn tag for ECS services, or aws:ecs:fargateTask with a value of true to apply the window to all Fargate tasks.

Previously, ACM automated certificate management for AWS-integrated services like Application Load Balancers and CloudFront. However, using ACM certificates with applications terminating TLS in Kubernetes required manual steps: exporting certificates and private keys via API, creating Kubernetes Secrets, and updating them at renewal. This integration extends ACM's automation to any Kubernetes workload for both public and private certificates, enabling you to manage certificates using native Kubernetes APIs.\n  With ACK, you define certificates as Kubernetes resources, and the ACK controller automates the complete certificate lifecycle: requesting certificates from ACM, exporting them after validation, updating Kubernetes Secrets with the certificate and private key, and automatically updating those Secrets at renewal. This enables you to use ACM exportable public certificates (launched in June 2025) for internet-facing workloads or AWS Private CA private certificates for internal services in Amazon EKS or other Kubernetes environments. Use cases include terminating TLS in application pods (NGINX, custom applications), securing service mesh communication (Istio, Linkerd), and managing certificates for third-party ingress controllers (NGINX Ingress, Traefik).

The enhancement improves graceful shutdown behavior by aligning Fargate task termination with each container’s preferred termination signal.\n  Previously, when an Amazon ECS task running on AWS Fargate was stopped, each Linux container always received SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL after the configured timeout. With the new behavior, the Amazon ECS container agent reads the stop signal from the container image configuration and sends that signal when stopping the task. Containers that rely on signals such as SIGQUIT or SIGINT for graceful shutdown can now run on Fargate with their intended termination semantics. If no STOPSIGNAL is configured, Amazon ECS continues to send SIGTERM by default.\n  Customers can use custom stop signals on Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate by adding a STOPSIGNAL instruction (for example, STOPSIGNAL SIGQUIT) to their OCI‑compliant container images. Support for container‑defined stop signals is available in all AWS Regions. To learn more, refer to the ECS Developer Guide.",
