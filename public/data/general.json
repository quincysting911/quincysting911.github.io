      "title": "Amazon RDS supports Multi-AZ for SQL Server Web Edition",
      "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for SQL Server now supports Multi-AZ deployment for SQL Server Web Edition. SQL Server Web Edition is specifically designed to support public and internet-accessible web pages, websites, web applications, and web services, and is used by web hosters and web value-added providers (VAPs). These applications need high availability, and automated failover to recover from hardware and database failures. Now customers can use SQL Server Web Edition with Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment option, which provides a high availability solution. The new feature eliminates the need for customers to use more expensive options for high availability, such as using SQL Server Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition.\n  To use the feature, customers simply configure their Amazon RDS for SQL Server Web Edition instance with Multi-AZ deployment option. Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ), and synchronously replicates data across the two AZs. In situations where your Multi-AZ primary database becomes unavailable, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to the standby replica, so customers can resume database operations quickly and without any administrative intervention.\n  For more information about Multi-AZ deployment for RDS SQL Server Web Edition, refer to the Amazon RDS for SQL Server User Guide. See Amazon RDS for SQL Server Pricing for pricing details and regional availability.",

      "description": "Recycle Bin for Amazon EBS, which helps you recover accidentally deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs, now supports EBS Volumes. If you accidentally delete a volume, you can now recover it directly from Recycle Bin instead of restoring from a snapshot, reducing your recovery point objective with no data loss between the last snapshot and deletion. Your recovered volume can immediately achieve the full performance without waiting for data to download from snapshots.\n  To use Recycle Bin, you can set a retention period for deleted volumes, and you can recover any volume within that period. Recovered volumes are immediately available and will retain all attributes—tags, permissions, and encryption status. Volumes not recovered are deleted permanently when the retention period expires. You create retention rules to enable Recycle Bin for all volumes or specific volumes, using tags to target which volumes to protect.\n  EBS Volumes in Recycle Bin are billed at the same price as EBS Volumes, read more on the pricing page. To get started, read the documentation. The feature is now available through the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS SDKs, or the AWS Console in all AWS commercial, China, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.",

When an unusual pattern is detected, CloudTrail provides the relevant data events from the anomaly period - helping you precisely investigate what led to the anomaly. You can configure alerts to be automatically notified when potential issues occur, enabling rapid response to potential threats or issues.\n  CloudTrail Insights for data events is available in all regions where AWS CloudTrail is available.

Each contact also records when ringing began and ended for precise reporting and traceability.\n  When ring duration is static, businesses struggle to balance calling efficiency and customer reach. Calls that ring too briefly may miss customers who take longer to answer, while excessive ring times delay overall campaign pacing. This lack of control leads to inconsistent contact rates and reduced agent productivity.\n  With configurable ring time, campaign managers can tune dialing behavior to their audience for each campaign, use analytics to see exactly how long each call rang, and understand where connections were missed. This visibility helps identify patterns, refine calling strategies, and continuously improve campaign effectiveness.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage.

      "description": "Amazon ECS Managed Instances (ECS Managed Instances) now gives you greater control over infrastructure optimization with configurable scale-in delay. This enhancement allows you to fine-tune instance management based on your specific workload patterns and business requirements, helping you better balance cost optimization with operational needs.\n  ECS Managed Instances is a fully managed compute option that automatically provisions right-sized Amazon EC2 instances based on your workload requirements. Over time, your compute resources may drift from workload requirements due to changing traffic patterns or dynamic scaling. ECS Managed Instances continuously monitors and proactively optimizes costs by terminating idle Amazon EC2 instances not running any tasks, and consolidating tasks from underutilized instances onto other, right-sized instances, provisioning new instances if required. ECS uses a heuristic based delay for scaling-in your instances to deliver a balance of high availability and cost optimization. However, your workloads or business may have unique requirements. For example, you might need to retain instances for a longer time period to accommodate incoming batch jobs and minimize instance churn. Starting today, you can set the scaleInAfter configuration parameter to up to 60 minutes to align with your specific infrastructure optimization needs. You can also set the scaleInAfter to -1 to disable infrastructure optimization workflows, which will allow your instances to run until they are patched after 14 days.\n  You can use ECS API, console, SDK, CDK, CloudFormation to configure scaleInAfter parameter when creating or updating an ECS Managed Instances capacity provider. This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions. To learn more, review documentation and deep dive blog post.",

This launch simplifies building multi-tenant applications on Lambda, such as SaaS platforms for workflow automation or code execution.\n  Customers building multi-tenant applications have strict isolation requirements when running code or processing data for individual tenants or end-users. Previously, customers met these requirements by implementing custom solutions, such as creating dedicated Lambda functions per tenant and routing requests from individual tenants to their associated functions. Today’s launch enables you to isolate request processing for each tenant invoking a Lambda function, helping you meet strict tenant isolation requirements without the need to build and operate custom solutions. This launch extends Lambda’s isolation boundary from a single function to each tenant invoking that function.\n  To use the new tenant isolation mode, customers specify a unique tenant identifier when invoking their Lambda function. Lambda uses this identifier to route invocation requests to a function’s underlying execution environments and ensures that execution environments associated with a particular tenant are never used to serve requests from other tenants invoking the function.\n  The new tenant isolation mode for AWS Lambda is available in all AWS Regions, except Asia Pacific (New Zealand), AWS GovCloud (US), and China.
