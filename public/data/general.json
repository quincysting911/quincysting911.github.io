MSK Connect enables you to run fully managed Kafka Connect clusters with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). With a few clicks, MSK Connect allows you to easily deploy, monitor, and scale connectors that move data in and out of Apache Kafka and Amazon MSK clusters from external systems such as databases, file systems, and search indices. MSK Connect eliminates the need to provision and maintain cluster infrastructure. Connectors scale automatically in response to increases in usage and you pay only for the resources you use. With full compatibility with Kafka Connect, it is easy to migrate workloads without code changes. MSK Connect will support both Amazon MSK-managed and self-managed Apache Kafka clusters.\n  You can get started with MSK Connect from the Amazon MSK console or the Amazon CLI.

Data collaborators can enable incremental processing for rule-based ID mapping workflows in AWS Entity Resolution, and then update an existing ID mapping table in a collaboration. For example, a measurement provider can maintain up-to-date offline purchase data in a collaboration with an advertiser and a publisher, enabling always-on measurement of campaign outcomes, reduced costs, and maintained privacy controls for all collaboration members.\n  AWS Entity Resolution is natively integrated within AWS Clean Rooms to help you and your partners more easily prepare and match related customer records. Using rule-based or data service provider-based matching can help you improve data matching for enhanced advertising campaign planning, targeting, and measurement.

      "description": "Amazon Redshift Serverless, which allows you to run and scale analytics without having to provision and manage data warehouse clusters, is now generally available in the AWS Asia Paciﬁc(Taipei) region. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, all users, including data analysts, developers, and data scientists, can use Amazon Redshift to get insights from data in seconds. Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically provisions and intelligently scales data warehouse capacity to deliver high performance for all your analytics. You only pay for the compute used for the duration of the workloads on a per-second basis. You can benefit from this simplicity without making any changes to your existing analytics and business intelligence applications.\n  With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can get started with querying data using the Query Editor V2 or your tool of choice with Amazon Redshift Serverless. There is no need to choose node types, node count, workload management, scaling, and other manual configurations. You can create databases, schemas, and tables, and load your own data from Amazon S3, access data using Amazon Redshift data shares, or restore an existing Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster snapshot. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, you can directly query data in open formats, such as Apache Parquet, in Amazon S3 data lakes. Amazon Redshift Serverless provides unified billing for queries on any of these data sources, helping you efficiently monitor and manage costs.\n  To get started, see the Amazon Redshift Serverless feature page, user documentation, and API Reference.",

      "description": "Amazon Redshift announces the general availability of Multidimensional Data Layouts (MDDL) that dynamically sort data based on actual query filters, accelerating query performance. Unlike traditional sorting methods that sort data based on fixed columns, MDDL sorts data based on query filters (for example, Sales in US), achieving up to 10x better end-to-end performance compared to using only optimal single-column sort keys for query workloads with repetitive query filters.\n  For each table with an AUTO sort key, which is the default for tables without an explicit sort key, Redshift analyzes the table’s query history and automatically selects either a single-column sort key or MDDL for your table, depending on potential performance improvements for your workload. Redshift with MDDL automatically constructs a multidimensional virtual sort key that co-locates rows typically accessed by the same queries. This virtual column, equivalent to a new sort key for the table, is subsequently used during query execution to skip data blocks and even skip scanning entire predicate columns. Redshift with MDDL provides a more expressive generalization of existing compound and interleaved sort keys that significantly improves the performance of table scans, especially when your query workload contains repetitive query filters. For pre-existing tables with manually defined sort keys, you can take advantage of MDDL by altering the sortkey of the table to AUTO.\n  MDDL is available in all AWS commercial regions where Redshift is available. To get started, read the documentation, blog, and Amazon Science publication to learn more about benchmarks on query performance improvements.",

For increased scalability, these instances offer instance sizes up to 48xlarge, including two metal sizes, up to 1,536 GiB of memory, and up to 60 Gbps of bandwidth to Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS). These instances support Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) networking on the 16xlarge, 24xlarge, 48xlarge, metal-24xl, and metal-48xl sizes, which enables lower latency and improved cluster performance for workloads deployed on tightly coupled clusters.\n  The new instances are available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), and US West (Oregon). Metal sizes are only available in US East (N. Virginia).\n  To learn more, see Amazon R8gn Instances. To begin your Graviton journey, visit the Level up your compute with AWS Graviton page. To get started, see AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs.",

After September, 2026 the Status field will be fully deprecated.

      "description": "Today, AWS has introduced five new Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) metrics to enhance network observability for AI/ML and High Performance Computing (HPC) workloads. These new metrics help diagnose performance issues by tracking retransmitted packets and bytes, retransmit timeout events, impaired remote connection events, and unresponsive remote receiver events.\n  With these new metrics, you can monitor for network congestion or instance configuration issues, allowing for timely action to maintain application performance. The metrics are implemented as counters at the per-EFA device level, accumulating data since instance launch or the most recent driver reset. Stored in the sys filesystem, these metrics counters are accessible via the instance command line. For enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities, you can integrate these metrics into Prometheus scripts, facilitating export to third-party tools such as Grafana for dashboard creation and alarm setting. The new metrics are available on Nitro v4 (and later) instances and require EFA installer version 1.43.0 or higher. For a full list of metrics and to learn more on how to use them, please visit the Monitor an EFA user guide. For a comprehensive list of instances built on different Nitro system versions, please refer to the AWS Nitro Systems documentation.\n  These new metrics are supported in all commercial AWS Regions, the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, and the China Regions. To learn more about EFA, please visit the EFA documentation.",

      "description": "AWS announces important configuration updates coming July 31st, 2025, affecting AWS SDKs and CLIs default settings. Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
