This feature introduces queue utilization data in job queue snapshots, revealing compute capacity used by your first-in-first-out (FIFO) and fair share job queues, along with capacity consumption by individual fair share allocations. Additionally, the ListServiceJobs API now includes a scheduledAt timestamp for AWS Batch service jobs, allowing you to track when jobs are scheduled for execution.\n  Queue and Share Utilization Visibility helps you understand which fair-share allocations consume the most capacity and pinpoint the specific jobs driving resource consumption. You can monitor overall queue utilization and drill down into active shares to optimize resource distribution, or filter jobs by share identifier to analyze consumption patterns and scheduling behavior across your workloads.\n  You can access this feature using the GetJobQueueSnapshot, ListJobs, and ListServiceJobs APIs, or through the AWS Batch Management Console by navigating to your job queue details page and selecting the new Share Utilization tab. This feature is available today in all AWS Regions where AWS Batch is available.

It also enhances your security posture through regular security patching initiated every 14 days. You can simply define your task requirements such as the number of vCPUs, memory size, and CPU architecture, and Amazon ECS automatically provisions, configures and operates most optimal EC2 instances within your AWS account using AWS-controlled access. You can also specify desired instance types in Managed Instances Capacity Provider configuration, including GPU-accelerated, network-optimized, and burstable performance, to run your workloads on the instance families you prefer.\n  To get started with ECS Managed Instances, use the AWS Console, Amazon ECS MCP Server, or your favorite infrastructure-as-code tooling to enable it in a new or existing Amazon ECS cluster. You will be charged for the management of compute provisioned, in addition to your regular Amazon EC2 costs.

Now, applications that commonly use NLB, such as those requiring TCP/UDP-based connections, low latency, long-lived connections, or static IP addresses, can take advantage of managed, incremental traffic shifting natively from ECS when rolling out updates.\n \nWith this launch, ECS customers using NLB can shift traffic in a controlled manner during deployments, such as moving traffic in increments or starting with a small percentage to validate changes before completing a rollout. These deployment strategies provide additional confidence during updates by allowing teams to observe application behavior at each traffic-shift step, and integrate with Amazon CloudWatch alarms to automatically stop or roll back deployments if issues are detected. This is especially valuable for workloads running behind an NLB, such as online gaming backends, financial transaction systems, and real-time messaging services.\n \nTo get started, select your NLB target groups, listener, and preferred deployment strategy in the ECS service configuration using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Infrastructure-as-Code tools.

Network segmentation is the practice of splitting a computer network into isolated subnetworks, or network segments. This reduces the attack surface so that if a host on one network segment is compromised, the hosts on the other network segments are not affected. Many customers in regulated industries such as manufacturing, health care and life sciences, banking, and others implement network segmentation as part of their on-premises network security standards to reduce the impact of a breach and help address compliance requirements.",

When you use AWS Lambda to process records from Apache Kafka topics, you frequently encounter two typical requirements: you need to process very high volumes of records in close to real-time, and you want your consumers to have the ability to scale rapidly to handle traffic spikes. Achieving both necessitates understanding how Lambda consumes Kafka streams, where the potential bottlenecks are, and how to optimize configurations for high throughput and best performance.",
