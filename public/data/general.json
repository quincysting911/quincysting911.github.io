      "description": "The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced .NET Data Provider Driver is now generally available for Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and MySQL-compatible databases. This advanced database driver reduces RDS Blue/Green switchover and database failover times, improving application availability. Additionally, it supports multiple authentication mechanisms for your database, including Federated Authentication, AWS Secrets Manager authentication, and token-based authentication with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).\n  The driver builds on top of Npgsql PostgreSQL, native MySql.Data, and MySqlConnector drivers to further enhance functionality beyond standard database connectivity. The driver is natively integrated with Aurora and RDS databases, enabling it to monitor database cluster status and quickly connect to newly promoted writers during unexpected failures that trigger database failovers. Furthermore, the driver seamlessly works with popular frameworks like NHibernate and supports Entity Framework (EF) with MySQL databases.\n  The driver is available as an open-source project under the Apache 2.0 license.

      "description": "Amazon Cognito user pools now supports AWS PrivateLink for secure and private connectivity. With AWS PrivateLink, you can establish a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and Amazon Cognito user pools to configure, manage, and authenticate against your Cognito user pools without using the public internet. By enabling private network connectivity, this enhancement eliminates the need to use public IP addresses or relying solely on firewall rules to access Cognito. This feature supports user pool management operations (e.g., list user pools, describe user pools), administrative operations (e.g., admin-created users), and user authentication flows (sign in local users stored in Cognito). OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow (Cognito managed login, hosted UI, sign-in via social identity providers), client credentials flow (Cognito machine-to-machine authorization), and federated sign-ins via SAML and OIDC standards are not supported through VPC endpoints at this time.\n  You can use PrivateLink connections in all AWS Regions where Amazon Cognito user pools is available, except AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Creating VPC endpoints on AWS PrivateLink will incur additional charges; refer to AWS PrivateLink pricing page for details. You can get started by creating an AWS PrivateLink interface endpoint for Amazon Cognito user pools using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or AWS CloudFormation. To learn more, refer to the documentation on creating an interface VPC endpoint and Amazon Cognito’s developer guide.",

This enhancement simplifies security-first container deployments by removing the need for manual permission management or custom entrypoint scripts.\n \nThis feature enhances container security by allowing tasks to run as non-root users, reducing the risk of privilege escalation and unauthorized access to data. Previously, for a container in a task to write to a mounted Amazon EBS volume, it had to run as the root user. ECS now automatically manages EBS volume permissions, simplifying workflows and ensuring that all containers within a task — regardless of user ID — can securely read and write to the mounted volume.\n \nThis feature is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon ECS and Amazon EBS are supported, for EC2, AWS Fargate, and ECS Managed Instances launch types.

      "description": "We're excited to announce a simplified pricing model for Amazon Cognito's machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication. Starting today we are removing the M2M app client pricing dimension, making it more cost-effective for customers to build and scale their M2M applications. Cognito supports applications that access API data with machine identities. Machine identities in user pools are clients that run on application servers and connect to remote APIs. Their operation happens without user interaction such as scheduled tasks, data streams, or asset updates. This change reduces the pricing of Cognito for customers using M2M authentication by removing the app client price dimension. Customers will continue to be charged based on the number of successful M2M token requests per month.\n  Previously, customers were charged for each M2M app client registered, regardless of usage amount, and each successful token request made by the app client to access a resource. With this change, customers will only pay for their successful token requests, making it more cost-effective to build and scale M2M applications using Amazon Cognito.\n  This pricing change is automatic and requires no action from customers. It is effective in all supported Amazon Cognito regions. To learn more about Amazon Cognito pricing, visit our pricing page.",

For example, Reachability Analyzer can help you identify a missing route table entry in your VPC route table that could be blocking network reachability between an EC2 instance in Account A that is not able to connect to another EC2 instance in Account B in your AWS Organization.\n  VPC Network Access Analyzer allows you to identify unintended network access to your AWS resources, helping you meet your security and compliance guidelines. For example, you can create a scope to verify that all paths from your web-applications to the internet, traverse the firewall, and detect any paths that bypass the firewall.\n  For more information, visit documentation for VPC Reachability Analyzer and VPC Network Access Analyzer. For pricing, refer to the Network Analysis tab on the Amazon VPC Pricing Page.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon announced two new Amazon CloudWatch metrics that provide insight into when your application exceeds the I/O performance limits for your EC2 instance with attached EBS volumes. These two metrics, Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check, monitor if the driven IOPS or throughput is exceeding the maximum EBS IOPS or throughput that your instance can support.\n  With these two new metrics at the instance level, you can quickly identify and respond to application performance issues stemming from exceeding the EBS-Optimized limits of your instance. These metrics will return a value of 0 (performance not exceeded) or a 1 (performance exceeded) when your workload is exceeding the EBS-Optimized IOPS or throughput limit of the EC2 instance. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can use these new metrics to create customized dashboards and set alarms that notify you or automatically perform actions based on these metrics, such as moving to a larger instance size or a different instance type that supports higher EBS-Optimized limits.\n  The Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check metrics are available by default at a 1-minute frequency at no additional charges, for all Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instances with EBS volumes attached. You can access these metrics via the EC2 console, CLI, or CloudWatch API in all Commercial AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions. To learn more about these CloudWatch metrics, please visit the EC2 CloudWatch Metrics documentation.",
