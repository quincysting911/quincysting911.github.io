Now, by completing this in one step, you can achieve faster recovery point objectives (RPOs) while eliminating costs associated with intermediate copies. This streamlined process also simplifies the workflow by removing the need for custom scripts or Lambda functions that monitor intermediate copy status.\n \nThis feature is available for all Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora engines, Amazon Neptune and Amazon DocumentDB, in all regions where AWS Backup supports cross-Region and cross-account copying of snapshots in separate steps.

This helps you coordinate simultaneous writes to the same object and prevents multiple concurrent writers from unintentionally overwriting the object.\n  You can now perform conditional copy operations through S3 CopyObject by including either the HTTP if-none-match header to verify object existence or the HTTP if-match header with ETag to validate the object’s content. Additionally, you can use the s3:if-match and s3:if-none-match condition keys in your S3 bucket policies to enforce conditional copy operations. S3 then evaluates the condition against the specified object's key or ETag before executing the copy operation in the destination bucket. This eliminates the need for additional client-side coordination mechanisms or API validation requests.\n  Conditional copy is available at no additional charge in all AWS Regions in both S3 general purpose and directory buckets.
