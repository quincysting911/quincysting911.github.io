      "description": "IAM Identity Center helps you configure the single sign-on experience of your workforce to AWS accounts and applications. You can now replicate IAM Identity Center from the primary AWS Region where you first enabled it to additional Regions of your choice. This feature enhances resilience of user access to AWS accounts and helps you deploy AWS applications in the AWS Regions that best align with your business needs such as application data residency and proximity to users.\n \nWhen you enable this feature, IAM Identity Center automatically replicates your identities, entitlements, and other information from the primary Region to additional Regions. If IAM Identity Center is affected by a disruption in the primary Region, IAM Identity Center users continue to have access to their AWS accounts using the already provisioned entitlements in the additional Regions. \n \nAWS application administrators can use the standard application deployment workflow to deploy their application in an additional Region. They can assign users to the application in that Region, while you continue to administer IAM Identity Center in the primary Region.\n  IAM Identity Center multi-Region support is currently available in the 17 enabled-by-default commercial AWS Regions for organization instances of IAM Identity Center connected to an external identity provider, such as Okta. The IAM Identity Center organization instance must be configured with a multi-Region customer managed KMS key (CMK). To find out which AWS applications support deployment in additional Regions, visit AWS applications that you can use with IAM Identity Center. Standard AWS KMS charges apply for storing and using CMKs. IAM Identity Center is provided at no additional cost. To learn more about IAM Identity Center, visit the product detail page. To get started, see the IAM Identity Center User Guide.",

This additional security layer prevents AWS IAM Identity Center administrators from bypassing multi-party approval controls by impersonating approvers through credential resets or authentication endpoint modifications.

The metric is available across cluster, service, task, and container-level dimensions, enabling customers to monitor health at their preferred level of granularity. Customers can create CloudWatch alarms on the metric to receive notifications when containers become unhealthy, allowing teams to take immediate action and maintain application reliability.\n  To get started, enable Container Insights with enhanced observability on your ECS cluster and configure a container health check in your task definition to start collecting the metric in CloudWatch.

This capability allows customers to quickly diagnose setup issues and take timely corrective actions to operate resilient data streaming workloads. This capability is available for both Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) and self-managed Apache Kafka (SMK) event source mappings.\n  Customers use Kafka event source mappings (ESM) with their Lambda functions to build mission-critical applications. However, the lack of visibility into event polling setup, scaling, and processing state for events slows down troubleshooting for issues resulting from faulty permissions, misconfiguration, or function errors, which increases mean time to resolution and adds operational overhead. With this launch, customers can enable CloudWatch Logs and metrics to monitor their Kafka polling setup, scaling, and event processing state. Customers can select from multiple log level options that provide logs ranging from warnings and errors to detailed information about event processing progress. Similarly, customers can enable one or more metrics groups—EventCount, ErrorCount, and KafkaMetrics—to monitor various aspects of event processing. Customers can view all their metrics and logs via a dedicated monitoring page on AWS Console for ESM. This capability allows customers to utilize their observability tooling to quickly diagnose setup issues and track performance metrics to meet their stringent business requirements.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Commercial Regions where AWS Lambda's Provisioned mode for Kafka ESM is available.\n  You can enable ESM logs and metrics for your Kafka ESM using AWS Lambda's Create and Update ESM APIs, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM. To learn more about these capabilities, visit the Lambda Kafka ESM developer documentation. These logs and metrics are charged at standard CloudWatch pricing.",

Previously, developers had to maintain running instances even during periods of low or no activity in order for Fleet autoscaling to remain active. This resulted in unnecessary infrastructure costs during off-peak hours. With automatic scaling to and from zero instances, game developers using Amazon GameLift Servers can optimize their multiplayer gaming infrastructure costs while maintaining responsive performance.\n  By eliminating charges for unused instances during inactive periods, while automatically scaling up when game sessions are requested, this new capability delivers significant cost savings for game developers. This is particularly valuable for games with distinct peak and off-peak periods, seasonal or event-based games, new game launches with uncertain traffic patterns, and regional games with time-zone specific activity. Additionally, scaling decisions no longer need manual intervention, as Amazon GameLift Servers intelligently adapts to natural gaming activity patterns.\n  The automatic scaling to zero instances capability is available in all Amazon GameLift Servers supported regions.

      "description": "Amazon RDS for Oracle now supports database replicas for instances set up in Oracle multi-tenant configuration. Oracle multi-tenant configuration allows customers to host multiple, isolated pluggable databases in a single container database, which allows for cost reduction through consolidation and easier management. With support for replicas in Oracle multi-tenant configuration, customers can now distribute read workloads to a replica to scale workloads, or setup cross-Region replicas. In disaster recovery situations, customers can promote replicas to serve as a new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica for a quick recovery.\n \nTo set up replicas in Oracle multi-tenant configuration, customers can create a replica in either mounted or read-only mode using the AWS management console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. Once a replica is set up, Amazon RDS for Oracle manages asynchronous physical replication between primary and replica database instances using Oracle Data Guard.\n \nAmazon RDS for Oracle read replicas use Oracle Data Guard. Using mounted mode replicas require an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license, and using read-only mode replicas require additional Oracle Active Data Guard licenses. We recommend customers to consult their Oracle licensing expert to determine Oracle licensing requirements. Refer to RDS for Oracle User Guide for more information, and Amazon RDS for Oracle pricing for available instance configurations, pricing, and region availability.",

Express based clusters deliver 3 times higher throughput, 20 times faster scaling capabilities, and 90% faster broker recovery compared to Amazon MSK Provisioned clusters. In addition, Express brokers support intelligent rebalancing for 180 times faster operation performance, so partitions are automatically and consistently well distributed across brokers. Intelligent rebalancing automatically tracks cluster health and triggers partition redistribution when resource imbalances are detected, maintaining performance across brokers. This post demonstrates how to use the intelligent rebalancing feature and build a custom solution that scales Express based clusters horizontally (adding and removing brokers) dynamically based on Amazon CloudWatch metrics and predefined schedules. The solution provides capacity management while maintaining cluster performance and minimizing overhead.",

When you use AWS Lambda to process records from Apache Kafka topics, you frequently encounter two typical requirements: you need to process very high volumes of records in close to real-time, and you want your consumers to have the ability to scale rapidly to handle traffic spikes. Achieving both necessitates understanding how Lambda consumes Kafka streams, where the potential bottlenecks are, and how to optimize configurations for high throughput and best performance.",
