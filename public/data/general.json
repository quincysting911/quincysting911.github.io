From the list and detail views, you can invoke the connect button, open a modal, and launch AWS CloudShell to start an SSM session directly into that instance.\n  These console improvements give hands-on tools to debug, inspect, and resolve issues faster. Instead of relying on external tooling or guesswork, directly investigate host performance, pull recent game server logs, or diagnose issues such as network configuration and instance health - all from within the Amazon GameLift Servers Console. This reduces turnaround time when troubleshooting and enhances visibility into what’s happening “under the hood” of a game server fleet.\n  SSM in Console is available in Amazon GameLift Servers supported regions, except AWS China.

You can also apply dynamic grouping based on how you organize applications—by teams, business units, criticality tiers, or other attributes.\n  With this new application performance monitoring (APM) capability, customers can quickly visualize which applications and dependencies to focus on while troubleshooting their distributed applications. For example, SRE and DevOps teams can now accelerate root cause analysis and reduce mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) through high-level operational signals such as SLOs, health indicators, changes, and top observations. The application map integrates with a contextual troubleshooting drawer that surfaces relevant metrics and actionable insights to accelerate triage. When deeper investigation is needed, teams can pivot to an application-specific dashboard tailored for troubleshooting. The map, drawer, and dashboard dynamically update as new services are discovered or as customers adjust how their environments are grouped—ensuring the view is always accurate and aligned with how teams operate.\n  This new capability is now available in all AWS commercial regions where Application Signals have launched , at no additional cost.

      "description": "Today, AWS announces the launch of Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Managed Instances, a new fully managed compute option designed to eliminate infrastructure management overhead while giving you access to the full capabilities of Amazon EC2. By offloading infrastructure operations to AWS, ECS Managed Instances helps you quickly launch and scale your workloads, while enhancing performance and reducing your total cost of ownership.\n  With ECS Managed Instances, you get the application performance you want and the simplicity you need. Simply define your task requirements such as the number of vCPUs, memory size, and CPU architecture, and Amazon ECS automatically provisions, configures and operates most optimal EC2 instances within your AWS account using AWS-controlled access. You can also specify desired instance types in Managed Instances Capacity Provider configuration, including GPU-accelerated, network-optimized, and burstable performance, to run your workloads on the instance families you prefer.\n  ECS Managed Instances dynamically scales EC2 instances to match your workload requirements and continuously optimizes task placement to reduce infrastructure costs. It also enhances your security posture through regular security patching initiated every 14 days. You can use EC2 event windows to schedule patching to occur within weekly maintenance windows, minimizing the risk of interruptions during critical hours.\n  ECS Managed Instances is now available in six AWS regions: US East (North Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). To get started with ECS Managed Instances, use the AWS Console, Amazon ECS MCP Server, or your favorite infrastructure-as-code tooling to enable it in a new or existing Amazon ECS cluster. You will be charged for the management of compute provisioned, in addition to your regular Amazon EC2 costs.

These customers often face a difficult trade-off: setting sampling rates too low risks missing critical traces during incidents, while setting them too high unnecessarily increases observability costs during normal operations.            \n Today, with adaptive sampling, you can automatically adjust sampling rates within user-defined limits to ensure you capture the most important traces precisely when you need them. This helps development teams reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) during incidents by providing comprehensive trace data for root cause analysis, while maintaining cost-efficient sampling rates during normal operations. Adaptive sampling supports two approaches, Sampling Boost and Anomaly Span Capture. These can be applied independently or can be combined together. Customers can use Sampling Boost to temporarily increase sampling rates when anomalies are detected to capture complete traces and Anomaly Span Capture to ensures anomaly-related spans are always captured, even when the full trace isn't sampled.\n Adaptive sampling is currently available in all commercial regions where AWS X-Ray is offered. For more information, see the X-Ray documentation. and CloudWatch pricing page for X-ray pricing details.",

      "description": "Region switch in Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC) is now available in the Asia Pacific (New Zealand) Region. Region switch allows you to orchestrate the specific steps to operate your cross-AWS account application resources out of another AWS Region. It provides dashboards for real-time visibility into the recovery process and gathers data from across resources and accounts required for reporting to regulators and compliance teams. Region switch supports failover and failback for active/passive multi-Region approaches, and shift-away and return for active/active multi-Region approaches. When you create a Region switch plan, it is replicated to all the Regions your application operates in. This removes dependencies on the Region you are leaving for your recovery.\n  To get started, build a Region switch plan using the ARC console, API, or CLI. To learn more, visit the ARC Region switch documentation and pricing page.",

      "description": "Today, we are announcing the availability of Route 53 Resolver Query Logging in Asia Pacific (New Zealand), enabling you to log DNS queries that originate in your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With query logging enabled, you can see which domain names have been queried, the AWS resources from which the queries originated - including source IP and instance ID - and the responses that were received. \n  Route 53 Resolver is the Amazon provided DNS server that is available by default in all Amazon VPCs. Route 53 Resolver responds to DNS queries from AWS resources within a VPC for public DNS records, Amazon VPC-specific DNS names, and Amazon Route 53 private hosted zones. With Route 53 Resolver Query Logging, customers can log DNS queries and responses for queries originating from within their VPCs, whether those queries are answered locally by Route 53 Resolver, or are resolved over the public internet, or are forwarded to on-premises DNS servers via Resolver Endpoints. You can share your query logging configurations across multiple accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). You can also choose to send your query logs to Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, or Amazon Data Firehose. \n  There is no additional charge to use Route 53 Resolver Query Logging, although you may incur usage charges from Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, or Amazon Data Firehose. To learn more about Route 53 Resolver Query Logging or to get started, visit the Route 53 Resolver product page or the Route 53 documentation.",

Additionally, customers that currently use custom scripts or services such as a Lambda for monitoring the status of the intermediate copy, to then trigger the second copy, can simplify these workflows by eliminating this process.\n \nCross-Region and cross-account snapshot copy is available on all Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora engines in all AWS Regions, including the AWS China Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.
