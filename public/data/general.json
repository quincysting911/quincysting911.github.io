There are over 2000+ learning sessions that focus on specific topics at various skill levels, and the compute team have created 76 unique sessions for you to choose. There are many sessions you can choose from, and we are here to help you choose the sessions that best fit your needs. Even if you cannot join in person, you can catch-up with many of the sessions on-demand and even watch the keynote and innovation sessions live.",

      "description": "AWS Fault Injection Service (FIS) now offers two new scenarios that help you proactively test how your applications handle partial disruptions within and across Availability Zones (AZs). These disruptions, often called gray failures, are more common than complete outages and can be particularly challenging to detect and mitigate.\n  The FIS scenario library provides AWS-created, pre-defined experiment templates that minimize the heavy lifting of designing tests. The new scenarios expand the testing capabilities for partial disruptions. \"AZ: Application Slowdown\" lets you test for increased latency and degraded performance for resources, dependencies, and connections within a single AZ. This helps validate observability setups, tune alarm thresholds, and practice critical operational decisions like AZ evacuation. The scenario works with both single and multi-AZ applications. \"Cross-AZ: Traffic Slowdown\" enables testing of how multi-AZ applications handle traffic disruptions between AZs.\n  With both scenarios, you can target specific portions of your application traffic for more realistic testing of partial disruptions. These scenarios are particularly valuable for testing application sensitivity to these more subtle disruptions that often manifest as traffic and application slowdowns. For instance, you can test how your application responds to degraded network paths causing packet loss for some traffic flows, or misconfigured connection pools that slow down specific requests.\n  To get started, access these new scenarios through the FIS scenario library in the AWS Management Console. These new scenarios are available in all AWS Regions where AWS FIS is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more, visit the FIS scenario library user guide. For pricing information, visit the FIS pricing page.",

This new capability makes it effortless for customers to execute automatic partition balancing operations when scaling their Kafka clusters up or down. Intelligent Rebalancing maximizes the capacity utilization of MSK Express-based clusters by optimally rebalancing Kafka resources on them for better performance, eliminating the need for customers to manage partitions themselves or via third-party tools. Intelligent Rebalancing performs these operations up to 180 times faster compared to Standard brokers.\n  MSK Express brokers are designed to deliver up to three times more throughput per-broker, scale up to 20 times faster, and reduce recovery time by 90 percent as compared to Standard brokers running Apache Kafka. With Intelligent Rebalancing, MSK Express-based clusters are continuously monitored for resource imbalance or overload based on intelligent Amazon MSK defaults to maximize cluster performance. When required, brokers are efficiently scaled, without affecting cluster availability for clients to produce and consume data. Customers can now take full advantage of the scaling and performance benefits of MSK Provisioned clusters for Express brokers while simplifying cluster management operations.\n  Intelligent Rebalancing is being rolled out for all new MSK Provisioned clusters with Express brokers in all AWS Regions, where Express brokers are available.

This advanced database driver reduces RDS Blue/Green switchover and database failover times, improving application availability. Additionally, it supports multiple authentication mechanisms for your database, including Federated Authentication, AWS Secrets Manager authentication, and token-based authentication with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).\n  The driver builds on top of Npgsql PostgreSQL, native MySql.Data, and MySqlConnector drivers to further enhance functionality beyond standard database connectivity. The driver is natively integrated with Aurora and RDS databases, enabling it to monitor database cluster status and quickly connect to newly promoted writers during unexpected failures that trigger database failovers. Furthermore, the driver seamlessly works with popular frameworks like NHibernate and supports Entity Framework (EF) with MySQL databases.\n  The driver is available as an open-source project under the Apache 2.0 license.

With AWS PrivateLink, you can establish a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and Amazon Cognito user pools to configure, manage, and authenticate against your Cognito user pools without using the public internet. By enabling private network connectivity, this enhancement eliminates the need to use public IP addresses or relying solely on firewall rules to access Cognito. This feature supports user pool management operations (e.g., list user pools, describe user pools), administrative operations (e.g., admin-created users), and user authentication flows (sign in local users stored in Cognito).

Creating VPC endpoints on AWS PrivateLink will incur additional charges; refer to AWS PrivateLink pricing page for details. You can get started by creating an AWS PrivateLink interface endpoint for Amazon Cognito user pools using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or AWS CloudFormation.

      "description": "We're excited to announce a simplified pricing model for Amazon Cognito's machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication. Starting today we are removing the M2M app client pricing dimension, making it more cost-effective for customers to build and scale their M2M applications. Cognito supports applications that access API data with machine identities. Machine identities in user pools are clients that run on application servers and connect to remote APIs. Their operation happens without user interaction such as scheduled tasks, data streams, or asset updates. This change reduces the pricing of Cognito for customers using M2M authentication by removing the app client price dimension. Customers will continue to be charged based on the number of successful M2M token requests per month.\n  Previously, customers were charged for each M2M app client registered, regardless of usage amount, and each successful token request made by the app client to access a resource. With this change, customers will only pay for their successful token requests, making it more cost-effective to build and scale M2M applications using Amazon Cognito.\n  This pricing change is automatic and requires no action from customers. It is effective in all supported Amazon Cognito regions. To learn more about Amazon Cognito pricing, visit our pricing page.",

Previously, you needed to perform this as a two-step process—first copying to a different Region, and then to a different account (or vice versa). Now, by completing this in one step, you can achieve faster recovery point objectives (RPOs) while eliminating costs associated with intermediate copies. This streamlined process also simplifies the workflow by removing the need for custom scripts or Lambda functions that monitor intermediate copy status.\n \nThis feature is available for all Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora engines, Amazon Neptune and Amazon DocumentDB, in all regions where AWS Backup supports cross-Region and cross-account copying of snapshots in separate steps. You can start using this feature today through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDKs. To get started, refer the AWS Backup documentation.",
