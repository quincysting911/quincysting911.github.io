      "description": "AWS Deadline Cloud now supports editing job names and descriptions after submission. This new feature makes it easier to organize and identify jobs after submission by updating names or adding useful tracking details in the description field.\n  Job names and descriptions are critical metadata for organizing and understanding between users and projects, often tracking things like shot and sequence number across systems. Previously they could only be set at job creation during submission, being able to edit them after submission allows you to fix issues in naming as well as add key tracking information to the job description for other users.\n  You can edit job names and descriptions using the AWS SDK, Deadline client, and Deadline Monitor.

      "description": "Amazon RDS for Oracle now supports database replicas for instances set up in Oracle multi-tenant configuration. Oracle multi-tenant configuration allows customers to host multiple, isolated pluggable databases in a single container database, which allows for cost reduction through consolidation and easier management. With support for replicas in Oracle multi-tenant configuration, customers can now distribute read workloads to a replica to scale workloads, or setup cross-Region replicas. In disaster recovery situations, customers can promote replicas to serve as a new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica for a quick recovery.\n \nTo set up replicas in Oracle multi-tenant configuration, customers can create a replica in either mounted or read-only mode using the AWS management console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. Once a replica is set up, Amazon RDS for Oracle manages asynchronous physical replication between primary and replica database instances using Oracle Data Guard.\n \nAmazon RDS for Oracle read replicas use Oracle Data Guard. Using mounted mode replicas require an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license, and using read-only mode replicas require additional Oracle Active Data Guard licenses. We recommend customers to consult their Oracle licensing expert to determine Oracle licensing requirements. Refer to RDS for Oracle User Guide for more information, and Amazon RDS for Oracle pricing for available instance configurations, pricing, and region availability.",

Express based clusters deliver 3 times higher throughput, 20 times faster scaling capabilities, and 90% faster broker recovery compared to Amazon MSK Provisioned clusters. In addition, Express brokers support intelligent rebalancing for 180 times faster operation performance, so partitions are automatically and consistently well distributed across brokers. Intelligent rebalancing automatically tracks cluster health and triggers partition redistribution when resource imbalances are detected, maintaining performance across brokers. This post demonstrates how to use the intelligent rebalancing feature and build a custom solution that scales Express based clusters horizontally (adding and removing brokers) dynamically based on Amazon CloudWatch metrics and predefined schedules. The solution provides capacity management while maintaining cluster performance and minimizing overhead.",

      "description": "AWS Outposts racks now support multiple local gateway (LGW) routing domains, enabling you to create up to 10 isolated routing domains per Outpost, each with independent route tables and BGP sessions to your on-premises network. This feature provides traffic separation between routing domains and enables both customer-owned IP (CoIP) and direct VPC routing (DVR) modes on the same Outpost.\n  With multiple LGW routing domains, you can segment on-premises network connectivity for different departments or business units sharing an Outpost. Each routing domain maintains its own LGW VIF Group, LGW Route Table, and VPC associations, preventing traffic from crossing between domains. You can configure multiple LGW routing domains through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.\n  Multiple LGW routing domains is available on second-generation Outposts racks at no additional charge. See the FAQs for Outposts racks for the latest list of supported AWS Regions.\n  To learn more about implementation details and best practices, check out this blog post or visit our technical documentation.",

      "description": "Today, AWS Deadline Cloud announces integration with Foundry Nuke CopyCat, allowing you to run machine learning training jobs for visual effects in the cloud. AWS Deadline Cloud is a fully managed service that simplifies render management for computer-generated 2D/3D graphics and visual effects for films, TV shows, commercials, games, and industrial design.\n  CopyCat learns visual effects, such as color corrections, beauty finishes, or deblurring, from a set of adjusted frames and automatically applies these adjustments across entire sequences. Instead of cleaning up frames one by one, you can fix a handful of representative frames and CopyCat will automatically apply these changes to the rest of your footage, saving you significant amounts of valuable time. With this integration, you can now train models by submitting CopyCat training jobs directly to your Deadline Cloud render farm. This gives you the ability to scale and run multiple training workloads in parallel while freeing up your artist workstations for creative work. You can monitor and track training jobs alongside other render jobs through the Deadline Cloud interface for one simple view across an entire project.\n  AWS Deadline Cloud with Nuke CopyCat integration is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Deadline Cloud is supported.

With job run-level cost allocation, now you can assign cost allocation tags to each job run, enabling fine-grained billing attribution at the individual job run level. Cost allocation tags at the job run level also allow you to track costs by domains within a single application.

The M8i instances are up to 30% faster for PostgreSQL databases, up to 60% faster for NGINX web applications, and up to 40% faster for AI deep learning recommendation models compared to M7i instances.\n  M8i instances are a great choice for all general purpose workloads, especially for workloads that need the largest instance sizes or continuous high CPU usage. The SAP-certified M8i instances offer 13 sizes including 2 bare metal sizes and the new 96xlarge size for the largest applications.\n  To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console. For more information about the new instances, visit the M8i instance page or visit the AWS News blog.",

Developers can use .NET 10 as both a managed runtime and a container base image, and AWS will automatically apply updates to the managed runtime and base image as they become available.\n  .NET 10 is the latest long-term support release of .NET and is expected to be supported for security and bug fixes until November 2028. This release provides Lambda developers with access to the latest .NET features, including file-based apps. It also includes support for Lambda Managed Instances, enabling you to run Lambda functions on Amazon EC2 instances while maintaining serverless operational simplicity, providing cost efficiency and specialized compute options. Powertools for AWS Lambda (.NET), a developer toolkit to implement serverless best practices and increase developer velocity, also supports .NET 10. You can use the full range of AWS deployment tools, including the Lambda console, AWS CLI, AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), AWS CDK, and AWS CloudFormation to deploy and manage serverless applications written in .NET 10.\n  The .NET 10 runtime is available in all Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions.\n  For more information, including guidance on upgrading existing Lambda functions, see our blog post.
