      "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for SQL Server now offers Microsoft SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition. SQL Server Developer Edition is a free edition of SQL Server that contains all the features of Enterprise Edition and can be used in any non-production environment. This enables customers to build, test, and demonstrate applications using SQL Server while reducing costs and maintaining consistency with their production database configurations.\n  Previously, customers that created Amazon RDS for SQL Server instances for development and test environments had to use SQL Server Standard Edition or SQL Server Enterprise Edition, which resulted in additional database licensing costs for non-production usage. Now, customers can lower the cost of their Amazon RDS development and testing instances by using SQL Server Developer Edition. Furthermore, Amazon RDS for SQL Server features such as automated backups, automated software updates, monitoring, and encryption for development and testing purposes will work on Developer Edition.\n  The license for Microsoft SQL Server Developer Edition strictly limits its use to development and testing purposes. It cannot be used in a production environment, or for any commercial purposes that directly serve end-users. For more information, refer to the Amazon RDS for SQL Server User Guide. See Amazon RDS for SQL Server Pricing for pricing details and regional availability.",

      "description": "Amazon RDS for SQL Server launches optimize CPU with support for M7i and R7i instance families, which reduce prices by up to 55% compared to equivalent previous generation instances. Optimize CPU optimizes Simultaneous Multi-threading (SMT) configuration to reduce commercial software charges. Customers can lower cost by upgrading to M7i and R7i instances from similar 6th generation instances. Furthermore, for memory or IO intensive database workloads, customers can get additional cost reduction by fine tuning optimize CPU configuration.\n  RDS for SQL Server price for database instance hours consumed is inclusive of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft SQL Server software charges. Optimize CPU disables SMT for instances with 2 or more physical CPU cores. This reduces the number of vCPUs, and the corresponding commercial software charges by 50% while providing the same number of physical CPU cores, and near equivalent performance. The most significant savings are available on 2Xlarge and higher instances, and instances that use Multi-AZ deployment, where RDS optimizes to reduce SQL Server software charges for only a single active node for most usage. For workloads that are memory or IO intensive, customers can fine tune the number of active physical CPU cores for further savings.\n  RDS for SQL Server supports M7i and R7i instances in all AWS Regions. With unbundled instance pricing, database costs are calculated with separate charges for third party licensing fees per vCPU hour, and third party licensing fees are not eligible towards your organization’s discounts with AWS. You can view Microsoft Windows and SQL Server charges associated with your usage on AWS Billing and Cost Management, and in monthly bills.
