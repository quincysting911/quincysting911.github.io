      "description": "Amazon Redshift today announces the general availability of Just-In-Time (JIT) ANALYZE capability for Apache Iceberg tables, enabling users to run high performance read and write analytics queries on Apache Iceberg tables within the Redshift data lake. The Apache Iceberg open table format has been used by many customers to simplify data processing on rapidly expanding and evolving tables stored in data lakes.\n  Unlike traditional data warehouses, data lakes often lack comprehensive table-level and column-level statistics about the underlying data, making it challenging for query engines to choose the most optimal query execution plans without visibility into the table and column statistics. Sub-optimal query execution plans can lead to slower and less predictable performance.\n  ‘JIT ANALYZE’ is a new Amazon Redshift feature that automatically collects and utilizes statistics for Iceberg tables during query execution, eliminating manual statistics collection while giving the query engine the information it needs to generate optimal query execution plans. The system uses intelligent heuristics to identify queries that will benefit from statistics, maintains lightweight sketch data structures, and builds high quality table-level and column-level statistics. JIT ANALYZE delivers out-of-the-box performance on par with queries that have pre-calculated statistics, while providing the foundation for many other performance optimizations.\n  The Amazon Redshift JIT ANALYZE feature for Apache Iceberg tables is now available in all AWS regions where Amazon Redshift is available. Users do not need to make any changes or enable any settings to take advantage of this new data lake query optimization.

Amazon Linux serves as the foundation for countless applications running on AWS, but developers often face lengthy processes when building packages from source code. SPAL addresses this challenge by offering ready-to-use packages that accelerate development workflows for teams working with AL2023 environments.\n  With SPAL, development teams can significantly reduce deployment times and focus on core application development rather than package compilation. This solution is particularly valuable for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need reliable packages for production workloads without the overhead of building from source. SPAL packages are derived from the community-maintained EPEL9 project, with AWS providing security patches as they become available upstream. AWS will continue expanding the repository based on customer feedback through the Amazon Linux 2023 GitHub repository.\n  Supplementary Packages for Amazon Linux (SPAL) is available in all AWS Commercial Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China.\n  To get started, review available packages in the SPAL repository and update your package management configuration to include the SPAL repository for Amazon Linux 2023. To learn more about this feature consult the SPAL FAQs or AWS Documentation.",

      "description": "AWS CloudFormation now offers capabilities that allow customers to catch deployment errors before resource provisioning begins and resolve them more efficiently. Change set creation now provides early feedback on common deployment errors. Stack events are now grouped by an operation ID with access through the new describe-operation API to accelerate analysis of deployment errors. This empowers developers to reduce deployment cycle times and cut troubleshooting time from minutes to seconds.\n  When you create a change set, CloudFormation now validates your template against three common failure causes: invalid property syntax, resource name conflict with existing resources in your account, and S3 bucket emptiness constraint on delete operations. If validation fails, the change set status shows ‘FAILED’ with a detailed status on the validation failure. You can then view details for each failure, including the property path associated with them, to pinpoint exactly where issues occur in your template. When you execute a validated change set, the deployment can still fail because of resource-specific runtime errors, such as resource limits or service-specific constraints. For troubleshooting runtime errors, every stack operation now receives a unique ID. You can zoom into the stack events for an operation and filter down to the events that caused the deployment to fail. This allows you to quickly identify root causes, reducing your troubleshooting time.\n  Get started by creating change sets through the CloudFormation Console, CLI, or SDK. View stack events by operation ID in the CloudFormation Console Events tab or via describe-events API. To learn more, visit the validate deployment and troubleshooting User Guide.",

      "description": "AWS CloudFormation launches drift-aware change sets that can compare an IaC template with the actual state of infrastructure and bring drifted resources in line with their template definitions. Configuration drift occurs when infrastructure managed by IaC is modified via the AWS Management Console, SDK, or CLI. With drift-aware change sets, you can revert drift and keep infrastructure in sync with templates. Additionally, you can preview the impact of deployments on drifted resources and prevent unexpected changes.\n  Customers can modify infrastructure outside of IaC when troubleshooting operational incidents. This creates the risk of unexpected changes in future IaC deployments, impacts the security posture of infrastructure, and hampers reproducibility for testing and disaster recovery. Standard change sets can compare a template with your last-deployed template, but do not consider drift. Drift-aware change sets provide a three-way diff between a new template, last-deployed template, and actual infrastructure state. If your diff predicts unintended overwrites of drift, you can update your template values and recreate the change set. During change set execution, CloudFormation will match resource properties with template values and recreate resources deleted outside of IaC. If a provisioning error occurs, CloudFormation will restore infrastructure to its actual state before deployment.\n  To get started, create a change set for an existing stack from the CloudFormation Console and choose “Drift-aware” as the change set type. Alternatively, pass the --deployment-mode REVERT_DRIFT parameter to the CreateChangeSet API from the AWS CLI or SDK. To learn more, visit the CloudFormation User Guide.\n  Drift-aware change sets are available in AWS Regions where CloudFormation is available. Refer to the AWS Region table to learn more.",

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) now includes enhancements that improve service availability during rolling deployments. These enhancements help maintain availability when new application version tasks are failing, when current tasks are unexpectedly terminated, or when scale-out is triggered during deployments.\n \nPreviously, when tasks in your currently running version became unhealthy or were terminated during a rolling deployment, ECS would attempt to replace them with the new version to prioritize deployment progress. If the new version could not launch successfully—such as when new tasks fail health checks or fail to start—these replacements would fail and your service availability could drop. ECS now replaces unhealthy or terminated tasks using the same service revision they belong to. Unhealthy tasks in your currently running version are replaced with healthy tasks from that same version, independent of the new version's status. Additionally, when Application Auto Scaling triggers during a rolling deployment, ECS applies scale-out to both service revisions, ensuring your currently running version can handle increased load even if the new version is failing.\n \nThese improvements respect your service's maximumPercent and minimumHealthyPercent settings. These enhancements are enabled by default for all services using the rolling deployment strategy and are available in all AWS Regions. To learn more about rolling-update deployments, refer Link.",

      "description": "AWS Lambda announces Provisioned Mode for SQS event-source-mappings (ESMs) that subscribe to Amazon SQS, a feature that allows you to optimize the throughput of your SQS ESM by provisioning event polling resources that remain ready to handle sudden spikes in traffic. SQS ESM configured with Provisioned Mode scales 3x faster (up to 1000 concurrent executions per minute) and supports 16x higher concurrency (up to 20,000 concurrent executions) than default SQS ESM capability. This allows you to build highly responsive and scalable event-driven applications with stringent performance requirements.\n  Customers use SQS as an event source for Lambda functions to build mission-critical applications using Lambda's fully-managed SQS ESM, which automatically scales polling resources in response to events. However, for applications that need to handle unpredictable bursts of traffic, lack of control over the throughput of ESM can lead to delays in event processing. Provisioned Mode for SQS ESM allows you to fine tune the throughput of the ESM by provisioning a minimum and maximum number of polling resources called event pollers that are ready to handle sudden spikes in traffic. With this feature, you can process events with lower latency, handle sudden traﬃc spikes more eﬀectively, and maintain precise control over your event processing resources.\n  This feature is generally available in all AWS Commercial Regions. You can activate Provisioned Mode for SQS ESM by configuring a minimum and maximum number of event pollers in the ESM API, AWS Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS SAM. You pay for the usage of event pollers, along a billing unit called Event Poller Unit (EPU). To learn more, read Lambda ESM documentation and AWS Lambda pricing.",

These disruptions, often called gray failures, are more common than complete outages and can be particularly challenging to detect and mitigate.\n  The FIS scenario library provides AWS-created, pre-defined experiment templates that minimize the heavy lifting of designing tests. The new scenarios expand the testing capabilities for partial disruptions. \"AZ: Application Slowdown\" lets you test for increased latency and degraded performance for resources, dependencies, and connections within a single AZ. This helps validate observability setups, tune alarm thresholds, and practice critical operational decisions like AZ evacuation. The scenario works with both single and multi-AZ applications. \"Cross-AZ: Traffic Slowdown\" enables testing of how multi-AZ applications handle traffic disruptions between AZs.\n  With both scenarios, you can target specific portions of your application traffic for more realistic testing of partial disruptions. These scenarios are particularly valuable for testing application sensitivity to these more subtle disruptions that often manifest as traffic and application slowdowns. For instance, you can test how your application responds to degraded network paths causing packet loss for some traffic flows, or misconfigured connection pools that slow down specific requests.\n  To get started, access these new scenarios through the FIS scenario library in the AWS Management Console.

This new capability makes it effortless for customers to execute automatic partition balancing operations when scaling their Kafka clusters up or down. Intelligent Rebalancing maximizes the capacity utilization of MSK Express-based clusters by optimally rebalancing Kafka resources on them for better performance, eliminating the need for customers to manage partitions themselves or via third-party tools. Intelligent Rebalancing performs these operations up to 180 times faster compared to Standard brokers.\n  MSK Express brokers are designed to deliver up to three times more throughput per-broker, scale up to 20 times faster, and reduce recovery time by 90 percent as compared to Standard brokers running Apache Kafka. With Intelligent Rebalancing, MSK Express-based clusters are continuously monitored for resource imbalance or overload based on intelligent Amazon MSK defaults to maximize cluster performance. When required, brokers are efficiently scaled, without affecting cluster availability for clients to produce and consume data. Customers can now take full advantage of the scaling and performance benefits of MSK Provisioned clusters for Express brokers while simplifying cluster management operations.\n  Intelligent Rebalancing is being rolled out for all new MSK Provisioned clusters with Express brokers in all AWS Regions, where Express brokers are available. Intelligent Rebalancing does not require any additional configuration or setup to get started. To learn more, see the Amazon MSK Developer Guide.",
