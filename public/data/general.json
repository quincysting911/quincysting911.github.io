This enhancement allows you to categorize data quality rules by business context, team ownership, compliance requirements, or any custom taxonomy that fits your data quality and governance needs.\n  Rule labels provide effective way to organize analyze data quality results. You can query results by specific labels to identify failing rules within particular categories, count rule outcomes by team or domain, and create focused reports for different stakeholders. For example, you can apply all rules that pertain to finance team with a label \"team=finance\" and generate a customized report to showcase quality metrics specific to finance team. You can label high priority rules with \"criticality=high\" to prioritize remediation efforts. Labels can be authored as part of the DQDL. You can query the labels as part of rule outcomes, row-level results, and API responses, making it easy to integrate with your existing monitoring and reporting workflows.\n  AWS Glue Data Quality rule labeling is available in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Glue Data Quality is available.

      "description": "AWS Device Farm enables web and mobile developers to test their applications using real mobile devices and desktop browsers. Today, we are announcing three new capabilities that make it easier to build better web and mobile experiences: a fully-managed Appium endpoint, support for environment variables, and IAM role integration.\n \nWith the new Appium endpoint, you can connect using just a few lines of code and run interactive tests on multiple physical devices directly from your IDE or local host. This feature works seamlessly with Appium Inspector —both hosted and local versions—for all actions, including element inspection. Support for live video and log streaming enables faster feedback within your local workflow.\n  Environment variables enable test filtering, test sharding, dynamic software version selection, and granular configuration of your test environment. You can pass simple key-value pairs to our test scheduling APIs, which are then configured as environment variables on the test host during runtime. This eliminates the need to maintain multiple test specification yaml files for different test scenarios and simplifies CI/CD pipelines by enabling dynamic test environment configuration.\n  Additionally, Device Farm test hosts can now assume IAM roles to connect with other AWS services, enabling workflows such as uploading artifacts to Amazon S3 and logging test output to Amazon CloudWatch. Both environment variables and IAM roles can be persisted at the project level, reducing the maintenance overhead of passing them to each run.\n  These features complement our existing server-side execution capabilities, giving you the scale, customizability and controls needed to run secure enterprise-grade workloads. Together, they help you author, debug, and test your mobile apps faster, whether working from your IDE, AWS Console, or other environments.\n \nTo learn more, see Appium Testing, Accessing other AWS resources, and Environment variables in the AWS Device Farm Developer Guide.",

The enhanced algorithm analyzes your AWS spend using rolling 24-hour windows, comparing current costs against equivalent time periods from previous days each time AWS receives updated cost and usage data.\n  The enhanced algorithm addresses two common challenges in cost pattern analysis. First, it removes the delay in anomaly detection caused by comparing incomplete calendar-day costs against historical daily totals. The rolling window always compares full 24-hour periods, enabling faster identification of unusual patterns. Second, it provides more accurate comparisons by evaluating costs against similar times of day, accounting for workloads that have different morning and evening usage patterns.

With Provisioned Control Plane, you can pre-provision the desired control plane capacity from a set of well-defined scaling tiers, ensuring the control plane is always ready to handle traffic spikes or unpredictable bursts. These new scaling tiers unlock significantly higher cluster performance and scalability, allowing you to run ultra-scale workloads in a single cluster.\n  Provisioned Control Plane ensures your cluster's control plane is ready to support workloads that require minimal latency and high performance during anticipated high-demand events like product launches, holiday sales, or major sporting and entertainment events. It also ensures consistent control plane performance across development, staging, production, and disaster recovery environments, so the behavior you observe during testing accurately reflects what you'll experience in production or during failover events. Finally, it enables you to run massive-scale workloads such as AI training/inference, high-performance computing, or large-scale data processing jobs that require thousands of worker nodes in a single cluster.\n  To get started with Amazon EKS Provisioned Control Plane, use the EKS APIs, AWS Console, or infrastructure as code tooling to enable it in a new or existing EKS cluster.

This capability allows you to simply provide your topic and target function in the MSK Console while the integration handles ESM configuration automatically, enabling you to trigger Lambda functions from MSK topics without switching consoles.\n  Customers use MSK as an event source for Lambda functions to build responsive event-driven Kafka applications. Previously, configuring MSK as an event source required navigating between MSK and Lambda consoles to provide parameters like cluster details, authentication method, and network configuration. The new integrated experience brings Lambda ESM configuration directly into the MSK Console with a simplified interface requiring only target function and topic name as mandatory fields. The integration handles ESM creation with optimized defaults for authentication and event polling configurations, and can automatically generate the required Lambda execution role permissions for MSK cluster access. To optimize latency and throughput, and to remove the need for networking setup, the integration uses Provisioned Mode for ESM as the recommended default. These improvements streamline MSK integration with Lambda and reduce configuration errors, enabling you to quickly get started with your MSK and Lambda applications.\n  This feature is generally available in all AWS Commercial Regions where both Amazon MSK and AWS Lambda are available, except Asia Pacific (Thailand), Asia Pacific (Malaysia), Israel (Tel Aviv), Asia Pacific (Taipei), and Canada West (Calgary).\n  You can configure Lambda’s Kafka event source mapping from the MSK Console by navigating to your MSK cluster and providing the topic, Lambda function, and optional fields under the Lambda integration tab.
