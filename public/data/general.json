      "description": "Amazon Connect now provides businesses with the ability to automatically evaluate the quality of self-service interactions and get aggregated insights to improve customer experience. Managers can define custom criteria to assess the quality of self-service interactions, that can be filled manually or automatically using insights from conversational analytics, and other Connect data. For example, you can automatically assess if the AI agent repeatedly fails to understand the customer, resulting in poor customer sentiment and transfer to a human agent. Managers can review these insights in aggregate and on individual contacts, alongside self-service interaction recordings and transcripts, to identify opportunities to improve AI agent performance.\n  Manually filled evaluations of self-service interactions are available in all regions where Amazon Connect is offered. Automated evaluations of self-service interactions are available in the following AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Europe (Frankfurt). For information about Amazon Connect pricing, please visit our pricing page. To learn more, please visit our documentation and our webpage.",

EKS Capabilities provides out-of-the-box platform features and offloads operations to AWS, improving the performance and security of your platform components.\n  EKS Capabilities streamlines building and scaling with Kubernetes, allowing you to focus on deploying applications rather than maintaining platform infrastructure. These capabilities run in AWS-owned infrastructure separate from your clusters, with AWS handling auto scaling, patching, and upgrading. Application developers get ready-to-use platform capabilities that enable faster workload deployment and scaling across the organization, while platform teams can offload operational tasks to AWS. Three capabilities are available at launch including continuous deployment with Argo CD, AWS resource management through AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK), and dynamic resource orchestration using Kube Resource Orchestrator (KRO).\n  EKS Capabilities is available today in all AWS Regions, except AWS GovCloud (US) and China Regions. To get started with EKS Capabilities, use the EKS API, CLI, eksctl, AWS Console, or your favorite infrastructure as code tooling to enable it in a new or existing EKS cluster.

All participating partners undergo rigorous technical validation by AWS experts to ensure they meet strict performance and operational requirements.\n  As Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon, explains: \"Everything fails, all the time. With validated and curated solutions from AWS Resilience Partners, customers can achieve in AWS, with a fraction of the cost, a higher system availability they could ever experience if still running critical workloads on-premises.\" This program follows AWS's shared responsibility model, where AWS manages cloud infrastructure resilience while providing customers with trusted tools and partners to ensure workload resilience.\n  To get started with the AWS Resilience Software Competency program and browse qualified partners, visit the AWS Resilience Competency page. Solutions are available through AWS Marketplace for streamlined procurement.",

You can query results by specific labels to identify failing rules within particular categories, count rule outcomes by team or domain, and create focused reports for different stakeholders. For example, you can apply all rules that pertain to finance team with a label \"team=finance\" and generate a customized report to showcase quality metrics specific to finance team. You can label high priority rules with \"criticality=high\" to prioritize remediation efforts. Labels can be authored as part of the DQDL. You can query the labels as part of rule outcomes, row-level results, and API responses, making it easy to integrate with your existing monitoring and reporting workflows.\n  AWS Glue Data Quality rule labeling is available in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Glue Data Quality is available.

Today, we are announcing three new capabilities that make it easier to build better web and mobile experiences: a fully-managed Appium endpoint, support for environment variables, and IAM role integration.\n \nWith the new Appium endpoint, you can connect using just a few lines of code and run interactive tests on multiple physical devices directly from your IDE or local host. This feature works seamlessly with Appium Inspector —both hosted and local versions—for all actions, including element inspection. Support for live video and log streaming enables faster feedback within your local workflow.\n  Environment variables enable test filtering, test sharding, dynamic software version selection, and granular configuration of your test environment. You can pass simple key-value pairs to our test scheduling APIs, which are then configured as environment variables on the test host during runtime. This eliminates the need to maintain multiple test specification yaml files for different test scenarios and simplifies CI/CD pipelines by enabling dynamic test environment configuration.\n  Additionally, Device Farm test hosts can now assume IAM roles to connect with other AWS services, enabling workflows such as uploading artifacts to Amazon S3 and logging test output to Amazon CloudWatch. Both environment variables and IAM roles can be persisted at the project level, reducing the maintenance overhead of passing them to each run.\n  These features complement our existing server-side execution capabilities, giving you the scale, customizability and controls needed to run secure enterprise-grade workloads. Together, they help you author, debug, and test your mobile apps faster, whether working from your IDE, AWS Console, or other environments.\n \nTo learn more, see Appium Testing, Accessing other AWS resources, and Environment variables in the AWS Device Farm Developer Guide.",
