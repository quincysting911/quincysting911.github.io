      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Managed Instances is now available in all commercial AWS Regions. ECS Managed Instances is a fully managed compute option designed to eliminate infrastructure management overhead while giving you access to the full capabilities of Amazon EC2. By offloading infrastructure operations to AWS, you get the application performance you want and the simplicity you need while reducing your total cost of ownership.\n  Managed Instances dynamically scales EC2 instances to match your workload requirements and continuously optimizes task placement to reduce infrastructure costs. It also enhances your security posture through regular security patching initiated every 14 days. You can simply define your task requirements such as the number of vCPUs, memory size, and CPU architecture, and Amazon ECS automatically provisions, configures and operates most optimal EC2 instances within your AWS account using AWS-controlled access. You can also specify desired instance types in Managed Instances Capacity Provider configuration, including GPU-accelerated, network-optimized, and burstable performance, to run your workloads on the instance families you prefer.\n  To get started with ECS Managed Instances, use the AWS Console, Amazon ECS MCP Server, or your favorite infrastructure-as-code tooling to enable it in a new or existing Amazon ECS cluster. You will be charged for the management of compute provisioned, in addition to your regular Amazon EC2 costs. To learn more about ECS Managed Instances, visit the feature page, documentation, and AWS News launch blog.",

With Amazon Redshift Serverless, all users, including data analysts, developers, and data scientists, can use Amazon Redshift to get insights from data in seconds. Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically provisions and intelligently scales data warehouse capacity to deliver high performance for all your analytics. You only pay for the compute used for the duration of the workloads on a per-second basis. You can benefit from this simplicity without making any changes to your existing analytics and business intelligence applications.\n  With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can get started with querying data using the Query Editor V2 or your tool of choice with Amazon Redshift Serverless. There is no need to choose node types, node count, workload management, scaling, and other manual configurations. You can create databases, schemas, and tables, and load your own data from Amazon S3, access data using Amazon Redshift data shares, or restore an existing Amazon Redshift provisioned cluster snapshot. With Amazon Redshift Serverless, you can directly query data in open formats, such as Apache Parquet, in Amazon S3 data lakes. Amazon Redshift Serverless provides unified billing for queries on any of these data sources, helping you efficiently monitor and manage costs.\n  To get started, see the Amazon Redshift Serverless feature page, user documentation, and API Reference.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon announced two new Amazon CloudWatch metrics that provide insight into when your application exceeds the I/O performance limits for your EC2 instance with attached EBS volumes. These two metrics, Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check, monitor if the driven IOPS or throughput is exceeding the maximum EBS IOPS or throughput that your instance can support.\n  With these two new metrics at the instance level, you can quickly identify and respond to application performance issues stemming from exceeding the EBS-Optimized limits of your instance. These metrics will return a value of 0 (performance not exceeded) or a 1 (performance exceeded) when your workload is exceeding the EBS-Optimized IOPS or throughput limit of the EC2 instance. With Amazon CloudWatch, you can use these new metrics to create customized dashboards and set alarms that notify you or automatically perform actions based on these metrics, such as moving to a larger instance size or a different instance type that supports higher EBS-Optimized limits.\n  The Instance EBS IOPS Exceeded Check and Instance EBS Throughput Exceeded Check metrics are available by default at a 1-minute frequency at no additional charges, for all Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instances with EBS volumes attached. You can access these metrics via the EC2 console, CLI, or CloudWatch API in all Commercial AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and China Regions. To learn more about these CloudWatch metrics, please visit the EC2 CloudWatch Metrics documentation.",

This integration supports Kinesis Data Streams API errors including throttling, internal errors, service unavailable, and expired iterator exceptions for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.\n  Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless data streaming service that enables customers to capture, process, and store real-time data streams at any scale.

This feature eliminates the previous need for custom implementation or to wait for actual production failures to verify error handling mechanisms. To get started, customers can create experiment templates through the FIS console to run tests directly or integrate them into their continuous integration pipeline. For additional safety, FIS experiments include automatic stop mechanisms that trigger when customer-defined thresholds are reached, ensuring controlled testing without risking application stability.\n  These actions are generally available in all AWS Regions where FIS is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

      "description": "Amazon Route 53 Profiles now supportsÂ AWS PrivateLink. Customers can now access and manage their Profiles privately, without going through the public internet. AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely over the Amazon network. When Route 53 Profiles is accessed via AWS PrivateLink, allÂ operations,Â such as creating, deleting, editing, and listing of Profiles, can be handled via the Amazon private network.Â \n  Route 53 Profiles allows you to define a standard DNS configuration, in the form of a Profile, that may include Route 53 private hosted zone (PHZ) associations, Route 53 Resolver rules, and Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule groups, and apply this configuration to multiple VPCs in your account.Â Profiles can also be used toÂ enforce DNS settings for your VPCs, with configurations forÂ DNSSEC validations, Resolver reverse DNS lookups, and the DNS Firewall failure mode. You can shareÂ Profiles with AWS accounts in your organization using AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM).Â Customers can useÂ Profiles with AWS PrivateLinkÂ in regions where Route 53 Profiles is available today, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. For more information about the AWS Regions where Profiles is available, seeÂ here.\n  To learn more about configuring Route 53 Profiles, please refer to the serviceÂ documentation.",

With a few clicks, MSK Connect allows you to easily deploy, monitor, and scale connectors that move data in and out of Apache Kafka and Amazon MSK clusters from external systems such as databases, file systems, and search indices. MSK Connect eliminates the need to provision and maintain cluster infrastructure. Connectors scale automatically in response to increases in usage and you pay only for the resources you use. With full compatibility with Kafka Connect, it is easy to migrate workloads without code changes. MSK Connect will support both Amazon MSK-managed and self-managed Apache Kafka clusters.\n  You can get started with MSK Connect from the Amazon MSK console or the Amazon CLI. Visit the AWS Regions page for all the regions where Amazon MSK is available. To get started visit, the MSK Connect product page, pricing page, and the Amazon MSK Developer Guide.",
