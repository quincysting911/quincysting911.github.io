      "description": "Amazon Neptune Analytics is now available in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region. You can now create and manage Neptune Analytics graphs in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region and run advanced graph analytics.\n  Neptune Analytics is a memory-optimized graph database engine for analytics. With Neptune Analytics, you can get insights and find trends by processing large amounts of graph data in seconds. To analyze graph data quickly and easily, Neptune Analytics stores large graph datasets in memory. It supports a library of optimized graph analytic algorithms, low-latency graph queries, and vector search capabilities within graph traversals. Neptune Analytics is an ideal choice for investigatory, exploratory, or data-science workloads that require fast iteration for data, analytical and algorithmic processing, or vector search on graph data. It complements Amazon Neptune Database, a popular managed graph database. To perform intensive analysis, you can load the data from a Neptune Database graph or snapshot into Neptune Analytics. You can also load graph data that's stored in Amazon S3.\n  To get started, you can create a new Neptune Analytics graphs using the AWS Management Console, or AWS CLI.

      "title": "Amazon DataZone is now available in 3 additional commercial regions",
      "description": "Amazon DataZone is now available in AWS Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Malaysia) and Europe (Zurich) Regions.\n  Amazon DataZone is a fully managed data management service to catalog, discover, analyze, share, and govern data between data producers and consumers in your organization. With Amazon DataZone, data producers populate the business data catalog with structured data assets from AWS Glue Data Catalog and Amazon Redshift tables. Data consumers search and subscribe to data assets in the data catalog and share with other collaborators working on the same business use case. Consumers can analyze their subscribed data assets with tools—such as Amazon Redshift or Amazon Athena query editors—that are directly accessed from the Amazon DataZone portal. The integrated publishing and subscription workflow provides access to auditing capabilities across projects.\n  For more information on AWS Regions where Amazon DataZone is available in preview, see supported regions.\n \nAdditionally, Amazon DataZone powers governance in the next generation of Amazon SageMaker, which simplifies the discovery, governance, and collaboration of data and AI across your lakehouse, AI models, and GenAI applications. With Amazon SageMaker Catalog (built on Amazon DataZone), users can securely discover and access approved data and models using semantic search with generative AI–created metadata, or they could just ask Amazon Q Developer using natural language to find their data. For more information on AWS Regions where the next generation of SageMaker is available, see supported regions. To learn more about the next generation of SageMaker, visit the product webpage.",

      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion now supports cross-account ingestion for push-based sources such as HTTP and OpenTelemetry (OTel). With this launch, customers can easily share OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines across AWS accounts without relying on additional configurations like VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway.\n \nThis capability makes it simpler for organizations with multiple accounts to centralize observability and analytics workflows. For example, a central logging team can create ingestion pipelines and grant access to development teams across different accounts, enabling them to ingest logs, metrics, and traces directly into OpenSearch domains or OpenSearch Serverless collections. This reduces operational overhead and lowers the cost of sharing ingestion pipelines across accounts.\n \nCross-account ingestion for Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion is available today in all AWS regions where OpenSearch Ingestion is offered. Customers can get started by creating resource policies in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI, and then enabling pipeline endpoints from their VPCs to ingest data seamlessly.\n \nTo learn more about this feature, see the Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide and the launch blog.",

      "description": "We are excited to announce the launch of disk-optimized vector support for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, offering customers a cost-effective solution for vector search operations without compromising on accuracy and recall rates. This new feature enables organizations to implement high-quality vector search capabilities while significantly reducing operational costs.\n  With the introduction of Disk Optimized Vectors, customers can now choose between memory-optimized and disk-optimized vector storage options. The disk-optimized option delivers the same high accuracy and recall rates as memory-optimized vectors at lower cost. While this option may introduce slightly higher latency, it's ideal for use cases where sub-millisecond response times aren't critical such as semantic search applications, recommendation systems, and other AI-powered search scenarios.\n  Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, our fully managed deployment option, eliminates the complexities of infrastructure management for search and analytics workloads. The service automatically scales compute capacity, measured in OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs), based on your workload demands.\n \nPlease refer to the AWS Regional Services List for more information about Amazon OpenSearch Service availability. To learn more about OpenSearch Serverless, see the documentation.",

      "description": "You can now run OpenSearch version 3.1 in Amazon OpenSearch Service. OpenSearch 3.1 introduces several improvements in areas like search relevance and performance, and introduces features that simplify development of vector-driven applications for generative AI workloads.\n \nThis launch incorporates Lucene 10 that enables optimized vector field indexing resulting in faster indexing times and reduced index sizes, sparse indexing for CPU and storage efficiency improvements, and vector quantization to reduce memory usage. Other key areas of improvement include improved range query performance, which benefits log analytics and time-series workloads, and reduced latency for high-cardinality aggregations.\n \nThis launch also introduces a new Search Relevance Workbench, which provides integrated tools for teams to evaluate and optimize search quality through experimentation. Additionally, this launch includes several improvements in vector search capabilities. First, Z-score normalization improves hybrid search reliability by reducing the impact of outliers and different score scales. Finally, you can now boost efficiency of searches using memory-optimized search that enables the Faiss engine to operate efficiently by memory-mapping the index file and using the operating system's file cache to serve search requests.\n \nFor information on upgrading to OpenSearch 3.1, please see the documentation. OpenSearch 3.1 is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon OpenSearch Service is available.",
