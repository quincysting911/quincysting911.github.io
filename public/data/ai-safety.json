      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) now supports tmpfs mounts for Linux tasks running on AWS Fargate and Amazon ECS Managed Instances, extending beyond the EC2 launch type. With tmpfs, you can now create memory‑backed file systems for your containerized workloads without writing this data to task storage.\n  tmpfs mounts provide a temporary file system that is backed by memory and exposed inside the container at a path you choose. This is ideal for performance‑sensitive workloads that need fast access to scratch files, caches, or temporary working sets, and for security‑sensitive data such as short‑lived secrets or credentials, because the data does not persist after the task stops. tmpfs also lets you keep the container root file system read‑only using the readonlyRootFilesystem setting while still allowing applications to write to specific in‑memory directories.\n  To get started, update your task definition so that the container definitions include a linuxParameters block with one or more tmpfs entries. For each tmpfs mount, specify the containerPath, size, and optional mountOptions. You can register or update task definitions using the Amazon ECS console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS CDK. This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon ECS, AWS Fargate, and Amazon ECS Managed Instances are supported. To learn more, see the LinuxParameters and Tmpfs sections in the Amazon ECS API Reference and the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.",

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Service Connect now supports Envoy access logs, providing deeper observability into request-level traffic patterns and service interactions. This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.\n  You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and TCP). This feature is available in AWS GovCloud (US-West) and AWS GovCloud (US-East) regions where Amazon ECS Service Connect is supported. To learn more, visit the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.",

Account tags are applied at the account level in AWS Organizations and automatically apply to all metered usage within tagged accounts, eliminating the need to manually configure and maintain separate account groupings in AWS Cost Explorer, Cost and Usage Reports, AWS Budgets, and Cost Categories.\n  With account tag support, customers can analyze costs by account tag directly in Cost Explorer and Cost and Usage Reports (CUR 2.0 and FOCUS). Customers can set up AWS Budgets and AWS Cost Anomaly Detection alerts on groups of accounts without configuring lists of account IDs. Customers can also build complex cost categories on top of account tags for further categorization. Account tags enable cost allocation for untaggable resources including refunds, credits, and certain service charges that cannot be tagged at the resource level. When new accounts join the organization or existing accounts are removed, customers simply add or update relevant tags, and the changes automatically apply across all cost management products. To get started, customers apply tags to accounts in the AWS Organizations console, then activate those account tags from the Cost Allocation Tags page in the Billing and Cost Management console. This feature is generally available in all AWS Regions, excluding GovCloud (US) Regions and China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia) Regions.\n  To learn more, see organizing and tracking costs using AWS cost allocation tags.",

With this new capability, you can submit a change request for a collaboration, including adding new members, updating member abilities, and modifying collaboration auto-approval settings. To maintain security, all collaboration members must approve change requests before updates take affect, ensuring that existing privacy controls remain protected. For transparency, all change requests are logged in the change history for member review. For example, when a publisher creates a Clean Rooms collaboration with an advertiser, the publisher can add the advertiser’s marketing agency as a new member that can receive the analysis results directly in their account, enabling faster time-to-insights and streamlined campaign optimizations with the publisher. This approach reduces onboarding time while maintaining the existing privacy controls for you and your partners.\n  With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development.

Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
