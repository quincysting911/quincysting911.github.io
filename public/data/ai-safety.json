      "description": "AWS Transform custom is now generally available, accelerating organization-specific code and application modernization at scale using agentic AI. AWS Transform is the first agentic AI service to accelerate the transformation of Windows, mainframe, VMware, and more—reducing technical debt and making your tech stack AI-ready. Technical debt accumulates when organizations maintain legacy systems and outdated code, requiring them to allocate 20-30% of their software development resources to repeatable, cross-codebase transformation tasks that must be performed manually. AWS Transform can automate repeatable transformations of version upgrades, runtime migrations, framework transitions, and language translations at scale, reducing execution time by over 80% in many cases while eliminating the need for specialized automation expertise.\n \nThe custom transformation agent in AWS Transform provides both pre-built and custom solutions. It includes out-of-the-box transformations for common scenarios, such as Python and Node.js runtime upgrades, Lambda function modernization, AWS SDK updates across multiple languages, and Java 8 to 17 upgrades (supporting any build system including Gradle and Maven). For organization-specific needs, teams can define custom transformations using natural language, reference documents, and code samples. Users can trigger autonomous transformations with a simple one-line CLI command, which can be scripted or embedded into any existing pipeline or workflow. Within your organization, the agent continually learns from developer feedback and execution results, improving transformation accuracy and tightly aligning the agent’s performance with your organization’s preferences. This approach enables organizations to systematically address technical debt at scale, with the agent continually improving while developers can focus on innovation and high-impact tasks.\n \nAWS Transform custom is now available in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region.\n \nTo learn more, visit the user guide, overview page, and pricing page.",

The standard Amazon KVS storage tier, now designated as the hot tier, remains optimized for real-time data access and short-term storage. The new warm tier enables long-term media retention with sub-second access latency at reduced storage costs.\n  The warm storage tier enables developers of home security and enterprise video monitoring solutions to cost-effectively stream data from devices, cameras, and mobile phones while maintaining extended retention periods for video analytics and regulatory compliance. Moreover, developers now have the flexibility to configure fragment sizes based on their specific requirements — selecting smaller fragments for lower latency use cases or larger fragments to reduce ingestion costs. Both hot and warm storage tiers integrate seamlessly with Amazon Rekognition Video and Amazon SageMaker, enabling continuous data processing to support the creation of computer vision and video analytics applications.\n  Amazon Kinesis Video Streams with the new warm storage tier is available in all regions where Amazon Kinesis Video Streams is available, except the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.\n  To learn more, refer to the getting started guide.",

MSK Replicator provides automatic asynchronous replication across MSK clusters, eliminating the need to write custom code, manage infrastructure, or setup cross-region networking. MSK Replicator automatically scales the underlying resources so that you can replicate data on-demand without having to monitor or scale capacity. MSK Replicator also replicates the necessary Kafka metadata including topic configurations, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and consumer group offsets. If an unexpected event occurs in a region, you can failover to the other AWS Region and seamlessly resume processing.\n  You can get started with MSK Replicator from the Amazon MSK console or the Amazon CLI. To learn more, visit the MSK Replicator product page, pricing page, and documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition now supports dynamic data masking through the new pg_columnmask extension, allowing you to simplify the protection of sensitive data in your database. pg_columnmask extends Aurora's security capabilities by enabling column-level protection that complements PostgreSQL's native row-level security and column level grants. Using pg_columnmask, you can control access to sensitive data through SQL-based masking policies and define how data appears to users at query time based on their roles, helping you comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.\n \nWith pg_columnmask, you can create flexible masking policies using built-in or user-defined functions. You can completely hide information, replace partial values with wildcards, or define custom masking approaches. Further, you can apply multiple masking policies to a single column and control their precedence using weights. pg_columnmask helps protect data in complex queries with WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY clauses. Data is masked at the database level during query processing, leaving stored data unmodified.\n \npg_columnmask is available for Aurora PostgreSQL version 16.10 and higher, and 17.6 and higher in all AWS Regions where Aurora PostgreSQL is available. To learn more, review our blog post and visit technical documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now supports Spot Instances, enabling customers to reduce GPU compute costs by up to 90% compared to on-demand instances on HyperPod . As AI workloads scale, optimizing infrastructure costs becomes increasingly critical. SageMaker HyperPod's Spot integration addresses this by allowing customers to automatically leverage spare EC2 capacity at significant discounts, while providing the managed AI experience customers enjoy on HyperPod. \n \nWith Spot Instances, organizations can run fault-tolerant workloads cost-effectively at scale. You can combine Spot with on-demand instances to balance cost optimization with guaranteed availability. The feature is available on HyperPod EKS clusters and integrates with Karpenter for intelligent auto-scaling, automatically discovering available Spot capacity and handling instance interruptions.\n \nYou can enable Spot Instances when creating instance groups through the CreateCluster API or AWS Console. The feature supports all instance types available on HyperPod, including CPUs and GPUs. Capacity availability depends on supply from EC2 and varies by region and instance type. Spot instance support is available in all regions where SageMaker HyperPod is currently available. To learn more, please refer to the documentation.",
