Customers can now create custom connectors to any REST-enabled data source and seamlessly integrate that data into their AWS Glue ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) jobs. This capability extends AWS Glue's existing connectivity to 100+ non-AWS data sources through 60+ native connectors and additional options on AWS Marketplace.\n  Previously, connecting to proprietary systems or emerging platforms required customers to build custom connectors by providing specialized JARs with the necessary libraries. The new native REST API connector eliminates this complexity, making it easier to integrate data from any REST-enabled source. It reduces operational overhead by eliminating the need to install, update, or manage custom libraries, freeing teams from maintenance burdens. The connector also enhances flexibility, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to new data sources as business needs evolve. It also streamlines ETL management by allowing data engineers to focus on data transformation and business logic rather than spending time building and maintaining connector infrastructure.\n  The AWS Glue REST API connector is available in all AWS commercial regions where AWS Glue is available.\n  You can start using the AWS Glue REST API connector using AWS Glue APIs, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).

This new feature provides customers with a consolidated view of all resources that depend on a specific security group, eliminating the need to manually check multiple services before making configuration changes. Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for AWS resources, and understanding their dependencies is critical for maintaining secure and stable infrastructure.\n  Previously, customers managing complex security group configurations had to navigate through multiple AWS services individually to identify dependencies before modifying or deleting security groups. This manual process required checking EC2 instances, Elastic Network Interfaces, ElastiCache clusters, RDS databases, and other services one by one, making it time-consuming and error-prone. The \"Related resources\" tab streamlines this workflow by displaying all dependent resources in a single location, enabling customers to quickly assess the impact of proposed changes and make informed decisions with confidence.

      "description": "Amazon CloudFront announces support for mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for origins, a security protocol that enables customers to verify that requests to their origin servers come only from their authorized CloudFront distributions using TLS certificates. This certificate-based authentication provides cryptographic verification of CloudFront's identity, eliminating the need for customers to manage custom security controls.\n  Previously, verifying that requests came from CloudFront distributions required customers to build and maintain custom authentication solutions like shared secret headers or IP allow-lists, particularly for public or externally hosted origins. These approaches required ongoing operational overhead to rotate secrets, update allow-lists, and maintain custom code. Now with origin mTLS support, customers can implement a standardized, certificate-based authentication approach that eliminates this operational burden. This enables organizations to enforce strict authentication for their proprietary content, ensuring that only verified CloudFront distributions can establish connections to backend infrastructure ranging from AWS origins and on-premises servers to third-party cloud providers and external CDNs. Customers can leverage client certificates issued by AWS Private Certificate Authority or third-party private Certificate Authorities, which they import through AWS Certificate Manager.\n  Customers can configure origin mTLS using the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDK, CDK, or CloudFormation. Origin mTLS is supported for all origins that support mutual TLS on AWS such as Application Load Balancer and API Gateway, as well as on-premises and custom origins. There is no additional charge for origin mTLS. Origin mTLS is also available in the Business and Premium flat-rate pricing plans.

This allows contact centers to set accurate customer expectations, provide convenient options such as callbacks when hold times are extended, and balance workloads effectively across multiple queues. By leveraging the improved estimated wait time metrics, contact centers can make more strategic routing choices across queues while gaining enhanced visibility for better resource planning. For example, a customer calling about billing during peak hours with a 15-minute wait is seamlessly transferred to a cross-trained team with 2-minute availability, getting help faster without repeating their issue. The metric works seamlessly with routing criteria and agent proficiency configurations.",

You can also change the customer-managed KMS key used to encrypt your data to comply with custom key rotation standards or enable the use of S3 Bucket Keys to reduce your KMS requests.\n  The Amazon S3 UpdateObjectEncryption API is available in all AWS Regions.

With this feature, customers can now use printer-specific capabilities such as double-sided printing, paper tray selection, finishing options (stapling, hole-punching), and color management directly from their Windows WorkSpaces.\n \nAdvanced printer redirection addresses the need for specialized printing features that require printer-specific drivers rather than generic drivers. This capability is ideal for organizations with users who need advanced printing features for professional documents, labels, or specialized output. The feature includes configurable driver validation modes (exact match, partial match, or name-only matching) to balance compatibility with feature support, allowing administrators to optimize for their specific environment. When matching drivers are not found, WorkSpaces automatically falls back to basic printing mode, ensuring users can always print.\n \nThis feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon WorkSpaces Personal is offered. Advanced printer redirection is supported on Windows WorkSpaces with Windows clients only, and requires WorkSpaces Agent version 2.2.0.2116 or later and Windows client version 5.31 or later. Matching printer drivers must be installed on both the WorkSpace and the client device.\n \nFor more information about advanced printer redirection in Amazon WorkSpaces, see Configure Printer Support for DCV in the Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide, or visit the Amazon WorkSpaces page to learn more about virtual desktop solutions from AWS.",
