You can use the UpdateObjectEncryption API to atomically change the encryption key of your objects regardless of the object size or storage class. With S3 Batch Operations, you can use UpdateObjectEncryption at scale to standardize the encryption type on entire buckets of objects while preserving object properties and S3 Lifecycle eligibility.\n  Customers across many industries face increasingly stringent audit and compliance requirements on data security and privacy. A common requirement for these compliance frameworks is more rigorous encryption standards for data-at-rest, where organizations must encrypt data using a key management service. With UpdateObjectEncryption, customers can now change the encryption type of existing encrypted objects to move from Amazon S3 managed server-side encryption (SSE-S3) to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). You can also change the customer-managed KMS key used to encrypt your data to comply with custom key rotation standards or enable the use of S3 Bucket Keys to reduce your KMS requests.\n  The Amazon S3 UpdateObjectEncryption API is available in all AWS Regions. To get started, you can use the AWS Management Console or the latest AWS SDKs to update the server-side encryption type of your objects. To learn more, please visit the documentation.",

With this feature, customers can now use printer-specific capabilities such as double-sided printing, paper tray selection, finishing options (stapling, hole-punching), and color management directly from their Windows WorkSpaces.\n \nAdvanced printer redirection addresses the need for specialized printing features that require printer-specific drivers rather than generic drivers. This capability is ideal for organizations with users who need advanced printing features for professional documents, labels, or specialized output. The feature includes configurable driver validation modes (exact match, partial match, or name-only matching) to balance compatibility with feature support, allowing administrators to optimize for their specific environment. When matching drivers are not found, WorkSpaces automatically falls back to basic printing mode, ensuring users can always print.\n \nThis feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon WorkSpaces Personal is offered. Advanced printer redirection is supported on Windows WorkSpaces with Windows clients only, and requires WorkSpaces Agent version 2.2.0.2116 or later and Windows client version 5.31 or later. Matching printer drivers must be installed on both the WorkSpace and the client device.\n \nFor more information about advanced printer redirection in Amazon WorkSpaces, see Configure Printer Support for DCV in the Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide, or visit the Amazon WorkSpaces page to learn more about virtual desktop solutions from AWS.",

      "description": "Amazon S3 Storage Lens provides organization-wide visibility into your storage usage and activity. S3 Storage Lens is now available in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, bringing metrics to help you optimize storage costs, identify data protection opportunities, and improve application performance.\n  S3 Storage Lens provides a single view of object storage usage and activity across thousands of accounts in an organization, with drill-downs to generate insights at multiple aggregation levels. You can optimize storage costs by identifying prefixes with incomplete multipart uploads or buckets accumulating non-current object versions. You can identify buckets that don’t follow your data protection best practices, such as using S3 Cross-Region Replication to replicate data across AWS Regions or S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object. With the newly added performance metrics, you can identify application performance constraints—for example, using request and object size distribution metrics to detect inefficient access patterns or tracking cross-Region data transfer to reduce latency and costs.\n  Amazon S3 Storage Lens is available in all AWS Regions. S3 Storage Lens is pre-configured to receive free metrics by default for all customers and 14 days of historical data. For more detailed visibility with up to 15 months data retention, you can upgrade to S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics. To learn more about S3 Storage Lens metrics, including free and advanced metrics, refer to the documentation. For S3 Storage Lens Advanced pricing details, visit the Amazon S3 pricing page.",

With this launch, you can create a single PySpark analysis template that allows different values to be provided by the Clean Rooms collaborator running a job at submission time without modifying the template code. With parameters in PySpark analysis templates, the code author creates a PySpark template with parameters support, and if approved to run, the job runner submits parameter values directly to the PySpark job. For example, a measurement company running attribution analysis for advertising campaigns can input time windows and geographic regions dynamically to surface insights that drive campaign optimizations and media planning accelerating time-to-insights.\n \n\n With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development.

The IP allocation policy configured centrally cannot be superseded by individual application teams, ensuring compliance at all times. Before this feature, IP administrators had to educate database administrators and application developers about IP allocation requirements for RDS instances and Application Load Balancers, and rely on them to always comply with best practices. Now, you can add IP-based filters for RDS and ALB traffic in your networking and security constructs like access control lists, route tables, security groups, and firewalls, with confidence that public IPv4 address assignments to these resources always come from specific IPAM pools.\n  The feature is available in all AWS commercial regions and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, in both Free Tier and Advanced Tier of VPC IPAM. When used with the Advanced Tier of VPC IPAM, customers can set policies across AWS accounts and AWS regions.
