Developers can now use AWS PrivateLink to establish VPC endpoints for all data plane operations, management APIs, and credential provider. This enhancement allows IoT workloads to operate entirely within virtual private clouds without traversing the public internet, helping strengthen the security posture for IoT deployments.\n  Additionally, IPv6 support for both VPC and public endpoints gives developers the flexibility to connect IoT devices and applications using either IPv6 or IPv4. This helps organizations meet local requirements for IPv6 while maintaining compatibility with existing IPv4 infrastructure.\n  These features can be configured through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS CloudFormation. The functionality is now generally available in all AWS Regions where the relevant AWS IoT services are offered. For more information about the IPv6 support and VPCe support, customers can visit the AWS IoT technical documentation pages.

      "description": "Amazon ECS Service Connect now supports seamless communication between services residing in different AWS accounts through integration with AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service-to-service communication across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect leverages AWS Cloud Map namespaces for storing information about ECS services and tasks. To enable seamless cross-account communication between Amazon ECS Service Connect services, you can now share the underlying AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to use the same namespace to register Amazon ECS Service Connect services residing in multiple AWS accounts, simplifying service discovery and connectivity. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. Cross-account connectivity support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale Amazon ECS workloads as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to common services.\n  This feature is available with both Fargate and EC2 launch modes in AWS GovCloud (US-West) and AWS GovCloud (US-East) regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation.

With VPC origins, customers can have their Application Load Balancers (ALB), Network Load Balancers (NLB), and EC2 Instances in a private subnet that is accessible only through their CloudFront distributions. With the support for cross-account VPC origins in CloudFront, customers can now leverage the security benefits of VPC origins while maintaining their existing multi-account architecture.\n  Customers set up multiple AWS accounts for better security isolation, cost management, and compliance. Previously, customers could access origins in private VPCs from CloudFront only if CloudFront and the origin were in the same AWS account. This meant customers who had their origins in multiple AWS accounts, had to keep their accounts in public subnets to get the scale and performance benefits of CloudFront. Customers then had to maintain additional security controls, such as access control lists (ACL), at both the edge and within regions, rather than benefiting from the inherent security of VPC origins. Now, customers can use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to allow CloudFront access to origins in private VPCs in different AWS accounts, both within and outside their AWS Organizations and organizational units (OUs). This streamlines security management and reduces operational complexity, making it easy to use CloudFront as the single front door for applications.\n  VPC origins is available in AWS Commercial Regions only, and the full list of supported AWS Regions is available here.

With this launch, you can now specify an AWS Secrets Manager secret containing the service account credentials, enabling you to strengthen your security posture by eliminating the need to store plain text credentials in application code or configuration files, and aligning with best practices for credential management. Additionally, you can use AWS Secrets Manager to rotate your Active Directory credentials and consume them when needed in FSx workloads.\n  You can now use AWS Secrets Manager to store your domain join service credentials for all FSx for Windows file systems and FSx for ONTAP Storage Virtual Machines in all AWS Regions where they are available. For more information, see Amazon FSx for Windows File Server documentation and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) now supports Multi-Region Replication in the Middle East (Bahrain) and Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Regions. With this expansion, customers can now replicate their Amazon Keyspaces tables to and from these Regions, enabling lower latency access to data and improved regional resiliency.\n  Amazon Keyspaces Multi-Region Replication automatically replicates data across AWS Regions with typically less than a second of replication lag, allowing applications to read and write data to the same table in multiple Regions. This capability helps customers build globally distributed applications that can serve users with low latency regardless of their location, while also providing business continuity in the event of a regional disruption.\n  The addition of Multi-Region Replication support in Middle East (Bahrain) and Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) enables organizations operating in these regions to build highly available applications that can maintain consistent performance for users across the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Customers can now replicate their Keyspaces tables between these regions and any other supported AWS Region without managing complex replication infrastructure.\n  You pay only for the resources you use, including data storage, read/write capacity, and writes in each Region of your multi-Region keyspace. To learn more about Amazon Keyspaces Multi-Region Replication and its regional availability, visit the Amazon Keyspaces documentation.",

Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
