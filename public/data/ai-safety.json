      "description": "In this post, we introduce a comprehensive solution for proactively managing Amazon Bedrock inference costs through a cost sentry mechanism designed to establish and enforce token usage limits, providing organizations with a robust framework for controlling generative AI expenses. The solution uses serverless workflows and native Amazon Bedrock integration to deliver a predictable, cost-effective approach that aligns with organizational financial constraints while preventing runaway costs through leading indicators and real-time budget enforcement.",

This feature fully automates compute, storage, and networking management for Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, EKS Auto Mode now supports FIPS-validated cryptographic modules through its Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to help customers meet FedRAMP compliance requirements.\n  EKS Auto Mode enables organizations to get Kubernetes conformant managed compute, networking, and storage for any new or existing EKS cluster. Its AMIs include FIPS-compliant cryptographic modules to help meet federal security standards for regulated workloads. EKS Auto Mode manages OS patching and updates, and strengthens security posture through ephemeral compute, making it ideal for workloads that require high security standards. It also dynamically scales EC2 instances based on demand, helping optimize compute costs while maintaining application availability.\n  Amazon EKS Auto Mode is now available in AWS GovCloud (US-East) and (US-West). You can enable EKS Auto Mode in any EKS cluster running Kubernetes 1.29 and above with no upfront fees or commitments—you pay for the management of the compute resources provisioned, in addition to your regular EC2 costs.\n  To get started with EKS Auto Mode, visit the Amazon EKS product page.

      "description": "Today, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) added visibility into the IP addresses used by Dedicated IP Addresses - Managed (DIP-M) pools. Customers can now find out the exact addresses in use when sending emails through DIP-M pools to mailbox providers. Customers can also see Microsoft Smart Network Data Services (SNDS) metrics for these IP addresses, giving them more insight into their sending reputation with Microsoft mailbox providers. This gives customers more transparency into the IP activities in DIP-M pools.\n  Previously, customers could configure DIP-M pools to perform automatic IP allocation and warm-up in response to changes in email sending volumes. This reduced the operational overhead of managing dedicated sending channels, but customers could not easily see which IP addresses were in use by DIP-M pools. This also made it difficult to find SNDS feedback, which customers use to improve their reputation. Now, customers can see the IPs in DIP-M pools through the console, CLI, or SES API. SES also automatically creates CloudWatch Metrics for SNDS information on each IP address, which customers can access through the CloudWatch console or APIs. This gives customers more tools to monitor their sending reputation.\n  SES supports DIP-M IP observability in all AWS Regions where SES is available.\n  For more information, see the documentation for information about DIP-M pools.",

This feature introduces a new patch state called \"AvailableSecurityUpdate\" that reports security patches of all severity levels that are available to install on Windows instances but do not meet the approval rules in your patch baseline.\n  As organizations grow, administrators need to maintain secure systems while controlling when patches are applied. The security updates notification helps prevent situations where customers could unintentionally leave instances unpatched when using features like ApprovalDelay with large values. By default, instances with available security updates are marked as Non-Compliant, providing a clear signal that security patches require attention. Customers can also configure this behavior through their patch baseline settings to maintain existing compliance reporting if preferred.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Systems Manager is available.

AgentCore lets you build agents faster, enable agents to take actions across tools and data, run agents securely with low-latency and extended runtimes, and monitor agents in production - all without any infrastructure management.\n \nWith general availability, all AgentCore services now have support for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), AWS PrivateLink, AWS CloudFormation, and resource tagging, enabling developers to deploy AI agents with enhanced enterprise security and infrastructure automation capabilities. AgentCore Runtime builds on its preview capabilities of industry-leading eight-hour execution windows and complete session isolation by adding support for the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, with broader A2A support coming soon across all AgentCore services. AgentCore Memory now offers a self-managed strategy that gives you complete control over your memory extraction and consolidation pipelines. AgentCore Gateway now connects to existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in addition to transforming APIs and Lambda functions into agent-compatible tools. It also supports Identity and Access Management (IAM) authorization enabling customers to leverage IAM in additional to OAuth for secure agent to tool interactions over MCP, and acts as a single, secure endpoint for agents to discover and use tools without the need for custom integrations. AgentCore Identity now offers identity-aware authorization, secure vault storage for refresh tokens, and native integration with additional OAuth-enabled services so agents can securely act on behalf of users or by themselves with enhanced access controls. AgentCore Observability now delivers complete visibility into end-to-end agent execution and operational metrics across all AgentCore services through dashboards powered by Amazon CloudWatch, and it is OTEL compatible, offering seamless integration with Amazon CloudWatch and external observability providers like Dynatrace, Datadog, Arize Phoenix, LangSmith, and Langfuse. AgentCore works with any open source framework (CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Google ADK, OpenAI Agents SDK) and any model in or outside Amazon Bedrock, giving you freedom to use your preferred frameworks and models, and innovate with confidence.\n \nAmazon Bedrock AgentCore is available in nine AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland).\n \nLearn more about AgentCore through the blog, deep dive using the AgentCore resources, and get started with the AgentCore Starter Toolkit. AgentCore offers consumption-based pricing with no upfront costs.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudWatch announces the general availability of generative AI observability, helping you monitor all components of AI applications and workloads, including agents deployed and operated with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. This release expands beyond runtime monitoring to include complete observability across AgentCore's Built-in Tools, Gateways, Memory, and Identity capabilities. DevOps teams and developers can now get an out-of-the-box view into latency, token usage, errors, and performance across all components of their AI workloads, from model invocations to agent operations. This feature is compatible with popular generative AI orchestration frameworks such as Strands Agents, LangChain, and LangGraph, offering flexibility with your choice of framework.\n  With this new feature, CloudWatch enables developers to analyzes telemetry data across components of a generative AI application. Customers can monitor code execution patterns in Built-in Tools, track API transformation success rates through Gateways, analyze memory storage and retrieval patterns, and ensure secure agent behavior through Identity observability. The connected view helps developers quickly identify issues - from gaps in VectorDB to authentication failures - using end-to-end prompt tracing, curated metrics, and logs. Developers can monitor their entire agent fleet through the \"AgentCore\" section in the CloudWatch console, which integrates seamlessly with other CloudWatch capabilities including Application Signals, Alarms, Sensitive Data Protection, and Logs Insights.\n  This feature is now available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Asia Pacific (Sydney).\n  To learn more, visit documentation. There is no additional pricing for Gen AI Observability, existing CloudWatch pricing for underlying telemetry data applies.",
