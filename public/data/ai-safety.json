      "description": "Amazon CloudWatch Database Insights now supports tag-based access control for database and per-query metrics powered by RDS Performance Insights. You can implement access controls across a logical grouping of database resources without managing individual resource-level permissions.\n  Previously, tags defined on RDS and Aurora instances did not apply to metrics powered by Performance Insights, creating significant overhead in manually configuring metric-related permissions at the database resource level. With this launch, those instance tags are now automatically evaluated to authorize metrics powered by Performance Insights. This allows you to define IAM policies using tag-based access conditions, resulting in improved governance and security consistency.\n  Please refer to RDS and Aurora documentation to get started with defining IAM policies with tag-based access control on database and per-query metrics. This feature is available in all AWS regions where CloudWatch Database Insights is available.\n  CloudWatch Database Insights delivers database health monitoring aggregated at the fleet level, as well as instance-level dashboards for detailed database and SQL query analysis. It offers vCPU-based pricing – see the pricing page for details. For further information, visit the Database Insights User Guide.",

This enhancement enables you to use your own encryption keys to protect policy content and tests, giving you full control over key management. Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is the first and only generative AI safeguard that helps correct factual errors from hallucinations using logically accurate and verifiable reasoning that explains why responses are correct.\n  This feature enables organizations in regulated industries like healthcare, financial services, and government to adopt Automated Reasoning checks while meeting compliance requirements for customer-owned encryption keys. For example, a financial institution can now use Automated Reasoning checks to validate loan processing guidelines while maintaining full control over the encryption keys protecting their policy content. When creating an Automated Reasoning policy, you can now select a customer managed KMS key to encrypt your content rather than using the default key.\n  Customer managed KMS key support for Automated Reasoning checks is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is offered: US East (N.

      "description": "AWS Systems Manager announces the launch of security updates notification for Windows patching compliance, which helps customers identify security updates that are available but not approved by their patch baseline configuration. This feature introduces a new patch state called \"AvailableSecurityUpdate\" that reports security patches of all severity levels that are available to install on Windows instances but do not meet the approval rules in your patch baseline.\n  As organizations grow, administrators need to maintain secure systems while controlling when patches are applied. The security updates notification helps prevent situations where customers could unintentionally leave instances unpatched when using features like ApprovalDelay with large values. By default, instances with available security updates are marked as Non-Compliant, providing a clear signal that security patches require attention. Customers can also configure this behavior through their patch baseline settings to maintain existing compliance reporting if preferred.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Systems Manager is available. To get started with security updates notification for Windows patching compliance, visit the AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager console. For more information about this feature, refer to our user documentation or update your patch baseline with the details here. There are no additional charges for using this feature beyond standard AWS Systems Manager pricing.",

      "description": "AWS Directory Service now supports IPv6 connectivity for Managed Microsoft AD and AD Connector. The IPv6 capabilities allow customers to deploy directories with IPv4-only, IPv6-only, or dual-stack configurations, helping organizations meet government mandates and standardize on next-generation Internet protocol.\n  The IPv6 support helps organizations meet regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal agencies' mandate to transition to IPv6 by 2025, while eliminating dual-protocol network complexity. This enables organizations to modernize their network infrastructure and comply with evolving security standards without maintaining separate IPv4 and IPv6 network stacks.\n  Customers can upgrade existing IPv4-only directories to dual-stack by enabling IPv6 in VPC subnets, then adding IPv6 support through the Directory Service Management Console. IPv6 capabilities are available in all AWS Directory Service regions, with IPv6 accessible through Console, CLI, and API.\n  To learn more, see the AWS Directory Service documentation.",

The self-service edition upgrade eliminates the need for support tickets when scaling Managed Microsoft AD directories.\n  The API-driven Standard to Enterprise Edition upgrade removes operational barriers that previously required coordinating maintenance windows with AWS support, enabling on-demand directory scaling with automated pre-upgrade snapshots and sequential domain controller upgrades. This streamlined process ensures data protection through automatic backup creation before upgrades begin, while the sequential upgrade approach maintains directory availability throughout the process.\n  Organizations can now scale their directory infrastructure in response to growing user bases or expanding application requirements without the delays associated with traditional support-driven upgrade processes. The programmatic approach enables integration with existing automation frameworks and infrastructure-as-code deployments.\n Directory size upgrades are available in all AWS Directory Service regions through the AWS SDK, providing consistent upgrade capabilities across global deployments.\n  To learn more, see the AWS Directory Service documentation and UpdateDirectorySetup API reference.",
