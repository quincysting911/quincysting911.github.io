      "description": "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) IP Address Manager (IPAM) now supports policies for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances and Application Load Balancers (ALB). This feature enables IP administrators to centrally configure and enforce IP allocation strategies for these resources, improving operational posture and simplifying network and security management.\n  Using IPAM policies, IP administrators can centrally define public IP allocation rules for AWS resources, such as RDS instances, Application Load Balancers and Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateways when used in regional availability mode, and Elastic IP addresses. The IP allocation policy configured centrally cannot be superseded by individual application teams, ensuring compliance at all times. Before this feature, IP administrators had to educate database administrators and application developers about IP allocation requirements for RDS instances and Application Load Balancers, and rely on them to always comply with best practices. Now, you can add IP-based filters for RDS and ALB traffic in your networking and security constructs like access control lists, route tables, security groups, and firewalls, with confidence that public IPv4 address assignments to these resources always come from specific IPAM pools.\n  The feature is available in all AWS commercial regions and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, in both Free Tier and Advanced Tier of VPC IPAM. When used with the Advanced Tier of VPC IPAM, customers can set policies across AWS accounts and AWS regions. To get started please see the IPAM policies documentation page.\n  To learn more about IPAM, view the IPAM documentation. For details on pricing, refer to the IPAM tab on the Amazon VPC Pricing Page.",

Quick is Amazon's new AI-powered workspace and agentic teammate that helps organizations get answers from their business data and move quickly from insights to action. As organizations navigate newly adopted AI agents and work with existing enterprise tools for CRM, support, collaboration, and more, users face fragmented experiences. Users are forced to switch between different interfaces, repeat context, and manually stitch together outputs. Quick enables users to work with third-party agents and enterprise tools from a single interface, eliminating the wasted time and cognitive load of constantly switching between applications.\n  With Quick, business users can now invoke specialized agents from Box, Canva, and PagerDuty to accomplish chat and automation tasks. For example, you can pull incident insights from PagerDuty, generate a presentation in Canva, and query documents stored in Box - all directly from Quick. Additionally, Quick has expanded its built-in actions to include integrations with GitHub, Notion, Canva, Box, Linear, Hugging Face, Monday.com, HubSpot, Intercom, and more. This enables Quick users to accomplish tasks like creating GitHub issues, summarizing meeting notes in Notion, managing their CRM, and more.

The new Quickstart setup, reduces the number of steps required to set up an Client VPN endpoint. You can now easily set up Client VPN endpoints with pre-defined default configurations, requiring only three key inputs: IPv4 CIDR, server certificate ARN, and subnet selection. For example, development teams in large organizations who use Client VPN for remote access to their VPC resources for quick testing can now create endpoints quickly with the new simplified setup process.\n  The Quickstart method is available alongside the existing Standard Setup option, giving you the flexibility to choose the approach that best fits your deployment needs. Additionally, when you create a VPC, the Client VPN Quickstart workflow is automatically suggested as a follow up step. Once endpoint creation is complete, you can immediately download the client configuration file to connect using your VPN client. You can later modify and enhance your endpoint configuration using the Client VPN standard console or API as your usage patterns evolve. This enhancement is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where AWS Client VPN is generally available.\n  To learn more about Client VPN:\n  \n \n \nVisit the AWS Client VPN product page\n \n \nRead the AWS Client VPN documentation",

With tmpfs, you can now create memory‑backed file systems for your containerized workloads without writing this data to task storage.\n  tmpfs mounts provide a temporary file system that is backed by memory and exposed inside the container at a path you choose. This is ideal for performance‑sensitive workloads that need fast access to scratch files, caches, or temporary working sets, and for security‑sensitive data such as short‑lived secrets or credentials, because the data does not persist after the task stops. tmpfs also lets you keep the container root file system read‑only using the readonlyRootFilesystem setting while still allowing applications to write to specific in‑memory directories.\n  To get started, update your task definition so that the container definitions include a linuxParameters block with one or more tmpfs entries. For each tmpfs mount, specify the containerPath, size, and optional mountOptions. You can register or update task definitions using the Amazon ECS console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS CDK.

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Service Connect now supports Envoy access logs, providing deeper observability into request-level traffic patterns and service interactions. This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.\n  You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and TCP). This feature is available with both Fargate and EC2 launch modes in AWS GovCloud (US-West) and AWS GovCloud (US-East) regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation. To learn more, visit the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.",

      "description": "AWS announces Cost Allocation tags support for account tags across AWS Cost Management products, enabling customers with multiple member accounts to utilize their existing AWS Organizations account tags directly in cost management tools. Account tags are applied at the account level in AWS Organizations and automatically apply to all metered usage within tagged accounts, eliminating the need to manually configure and maintain separate account groupings in AWS Cost Explorer, Cost and Usage Reports, AWS Budgets, and Cost Categories.\n  With account tag support, customers can analyze costs by account tag directly in Cost Explorer and Cost and Usage Reports (CUR 2.0 and FOCUS). Customers can set up AWS Budgets and AWS Cost Anomaly Detection alerts on groups of accounts without configuring lists of account IDs. Customers can also build complex cost categories on top of account tags for further categorization. Account tags enable cost allocation for untaggable resources including refunds, credits, and certain service charges that cannot be tagged at the resource level. When new accounts join the organization or existing accounts are removed, customers simply add or update relevant tags, and the changes automatically apply across all cost management products. To get started, customers apply tags to accounts in the AWS Organizations console, then activate those account tags from the Cost Allocation Tags page in the Billing and Cost Management console. This feature is generally available in all AWS Regions, excluding GovCloud (US) Regions and China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia) Regions.\n  To learn more, see organizing and tracking costs using AWS cost allocation tags.",

With this new capability, you can submit a change request for a collaboration, including adding new members, updating member abilities, and modifying collaboration auto-approval settings. To maintain security, all collaboration members must approve change requests before updates take affect, ensuring that existing privacy controls remain protected. For transparency, all change requests are logged in the change history for member review. For example, when a publisher creates a Clean Rooms collaboration with an advertiser, the publisher can add the advertiser’s marketing agency as a new member that can receive the analysis results directly in their account, enabling faster time-to-insights and streamlined campaign optimizations with the publisher. This approach reduces onboarding time while maintaining the existing privacy controls for you and your partners.\n  With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development. For more information about the AWS Regions where AWS Clean Rooms is available, see the AWS Regions table. To learn more about collaborating with AWS Clean Rooms, visit AWS Clean Rooms.",
