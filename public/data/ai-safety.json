      "description": "AWS Cloud Map now supports cross-account service discovery through integration with AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This enhancement lets you seamlessly manage and discover cloud resources—such as Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon DynamoDB tables—across AWS accounts. By sharing your AWS Cloud Map namespace via AWS RAM, workloads in other accounts can discover and manage resources registered in that namespace. This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service discovery across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  You can now share your AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to maintain a centralized service registry—or a small set of registries—and share them across multiple accounts, simplifying service discovery. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. AWS Cloud Map's cross-account service discovery support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale service discovery as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to namespaces.\n  This feature is available now in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation. To learn more, please refer to the AWS Cloud Map documentation.",

This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.\n  You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and TCP). This feature is available in all regions where Amazon ECS Service Connect is supported.

      "description": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is excited to announce the launch of our second Secret Region - AWS Secret-West. With this launch, AWS now offers two regions capable of operating mission-critical workloads at the Secret U.S. security classification level. AWS Secret-West places cloud resources in closer proximity to users and mission in the western U.S., delivering enhanced performance for latency-sensitive workloads and improving operational efficiency. Additionally, the region provides customers with multi-region resiliency capabilities and geographic separation to best meet their U.S. Government mission requirements.\n  Architected for Security and Compliance\n Security is the highest priority at AWS. With the AWS Secret-West Region, customers benefit from data centers and network architecture designed, built, accredited, and operated for security compliance with Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) requirements. The region features multiple Availability Zones, providing the high availability, fault tolerance, and resilience that mission-critical workloads require.\n  Mission Workload Support\n The AWS Secret-West Region allows customers to:\n • Build and run mission-critical applications with enhanced geographic distribution\n • Process and analyze sensitive data across multiple regions\n • Deploy robust disaster recovery strategies\n • Leverage comprehensive compute and storage solutions located in the western U.S.\n • Utilize services authorized at ICD 503 and Department of Defense (DoD) Security Requirements Guide (SRG) Impact Level (IL6) supporting Intelligence Community and Department of Defense authority to operate mission needs.\n  To learn more about the AWS Secret-West Region and how to get started, contact us.",

This feature fully automates compute, storage, and networking management for Kubernetes clusters. Additionally, EKS Auto Mode now supports FIPS-validated cryptographic modules through its Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to help customers meet FedRAMP compliance requirements.\n  EKS Auto Mode enables organizations to get Kubernetes conformant managed compute, networking, and storage for any new or existing EKS cluster. Its AMIs include FIPS-compliant cryptographic modules to help meet federal security standards for regulated workloads. EKS Auto Mode manages OS patching and updates, and strengthens security posture through ephemeral compute, making it ideal for workloads that require high security standards. It also dynamically scales EC2 instances based on demand, helping optimize compute costs while maintaining application availability.\n  Amazon EKS Auto Mode is now available in AWS GovCloud (US-East) and (US-West). You can enable EKS Auto Mode in any EKS cluster running Kubernetes 1.29 and above with no upfront fees or commitments—you pay for the management of the compute resources provisioned, in addition to your regular EC2 costs.\n  To get started with EKS Auto Mode, visit the Amazon EKS product page.
