With this new capability, you can centrally configure and manage scan types—such as Amazon EC2 scanning, ECR scanning, Lambda standard and Code Scanning, and Code Security — across all the accounts in your organization, selected organizational units (OUs), or individual accounts. The new Inspector policy type within AWS Organization simplifies your service onboarding, management, and ensures consistent, organization-wide vulnerability scanning coverage.\n  This feature helps you maintain a uniform security baseline by automating Inspector enablement through a single AWS Organization policy. To get started, designate a delegated admin within Amazon Inspector, enable the “Inspector policies” policy type in the AWS Organizations console, and create a policy that specifies the desired scan types and Regions. Once attached to your organization root or OUs, Inspector will automatically be enabled for all the specified scan-types across covered accounts . When the Inspector policy is created and attached, all in-scope accounts automatically are aligned with your Organization-wide policy definition. New accounts that join the organization or are moved into an OU with an attached policy, inherit Inspector enablement automatically—reducing operational overhead and eliminating coverage gaps.\n  Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans AWS workloads including Amazon EC2 instances, container images, AWS Lambda functions, and code repositories for software vulnerabilities, code vulnerabilities, and unintended network exposure across your entire AWS organization. The AWS Organizations Inspector policy for organization-wide enablement is available at no additional cost to Amazon Inspector customers in all AWS commercial, China, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where Amazon Inspector is available.\n  To learn more about Amazon Inspector policies within AWS Organization, visit:\n  \n \n \nGetting started with Amazon Inspector\n \n \nManaging organization policies with AWS Organizations",

To protect proprietary pricing information, Billing Transfer is integrated with AWS Billing Conductor. This integration enables billing administrators to control how the cost data will be seen by their AWS organizations and implement advanced cost allocation strategies across multiple AWS organizations. For AWS Billing Transfer customers, there is no cost to use AWS Billing Conductor when they choose an AWS managed pricing plan. If they choose a Customer managed pricing plan, there will be a fee of $50 per AWS Organization. AWS offers a free trial for Billing Transfer through May 31, 2026. During this period, both AWS managed and Customer managed pricing plans in Billing Conductor are available at no charge. Starting June 1, 2026, Billing Transfer customers will be charged by the number of AWS organizations with Customer managed pricing plan attached to it.\n \nIf you’re using Billing Conductor on its own without Billing Transfer, you will still follow the standard per-account pricing model regardless of the type of pricing plan used (see pricing details).\n \nBilling Transfer is available today in all public AWS Regions, excluding the GovCloud, China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia) Regions.\n To learn more about using Billing Transfer to centralize billing and cost management across your multi-organization environment, visit Billing Transfer product page, AWS Billing documentation, AWS Cost Management documentation, and news blog.",

Users can benefit from discovery and \"Try It\" button for API exploration.\n  Portals deliver three benefits that address the pressing challenges in API management today. They eliminate the security risks of third-party solutions by keeping all API configurations within AWS boundaries while providing access control for internal and external audiences. Portals also reduce developer onboarding time from weeks to minutes through automated portal generation, and documentation that updates as APIs evolve. This eliminates the weeks of infrastructure setup and also promotes re-use across developer teams. Portals also provide visibility into developer portal usage and analytics, through CloudWatch RUM (Real User Monitoring) making it easier to understand user engagement.\n  To learn about pricing for this feature, please see the Amazon API Gateway pricing page. Amazon API Gateway Portals is available in all AWS Regions, excluding the AWS GovCloud (US) and China Regions. To get started, visit Amazon API Gateway documentation and AWS blog post.",

Previously available only for AWS services, this capability helps you identify unusual spending patterns across your entire AWS organization without manual configuration.\n  As organizations scale, you need visibility into costs for individual accounts, teams, or business units to maintain accountability and quickly identify anomalies. For example, if you track 500 application teams using a 'team' cost allocation tag, you previously needed to create and maintain 500 individual monitors. Now, you can create a single managed monitor that automatically tracks each team's spending separately. When your organization evolves—such as 'team-mobile' splitting into 'team-ios' and 'team-android'—both new teams are automatically monitored individually without any configuration changes, ensuring continuous anomaly detection as your organization grows.\n  The extension of AWS managed monitors to linked accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories is available today in all commercial AWS Regions at no additional charge.\n  To learn more, visit AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, or read our blog post.

You can assign a logically air-gapped vault as the primary target in backup plans, organization-wide policies, or on-demand backups. Previously, logically air-gapped vaults could only store copies of existing backups.\n \nThis capability reduces storage costs for customers who want the security and recoverability benefits of logically air-gapped vaults. Organizations wanting those benefits can now back up directly to a logically air-gapped vault without storing multiple backups.\n \nResource types that support full AWS Backup management back up directly to the specified air-gapped vault. For resource types without full management support, AWS Backup creates a temporary snapshot in a standard vault, copies it to the air-gapped vault, then removes the snapshot.\n \nThis feature is available in all AWS Regions that support logically air-gapped vaults. To get started, select a logically air-gapped vault as your primary backup target in the AWS Backup console, API, or CLI. For more information, visit the AWS Backup product page and documentation.",
