      "description": "Today, Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio announced new capabilities allowing SageMaker projects to add custom tags to resources created through the project. This helps customers enforce tagging standards that conform to Service Control Policies (SCP) and helps enable cost tracking reporting practices on resources created across the organization.\n  As an Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio administrator, you can configure a project profile with tag configurations that will be pushed down to all projects using the project profile. Project profiles can be setup to pass Key and Value tag pairings or pass the Key of the tag with a default Value that can be modified during project creation. All tag values passed to the project will result in the resources created by that project being tagged. This provides administrators a governance mechanism that enforces project resources have the expected tags.\n  This first release of custom tags for project resources is supported only through application programming interface (API).\n  Custom tags for project resources capability is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio is supported, including: Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), South America (São Paulo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Europe (London), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm)\n  To learn more, visit Amazon SageMaker then get started with the custom tag API documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudFront announces cross-account support for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) origins, enabling customers to access VPC origins that reside in different AWS accounts from their CloudFront distributions. With VPC origins, customers can have their Application Load Balancers (ALB), Network Load Balancers (NLB), and EC2 Instances in a private subnet that is accessible only through their CloudFront distributions. With the support for cross-account VPC origins in CloudFront, customers can now leverage the security benefits of VPC origins while maintaining their existing multi-account architecture.\n  Customers set up multiple AWS accounts for better security isolation, cost management, and compliance. Previously, customers could access origins in private VPCs from CloudFront only if CloudFront and the origin were in the same AWS account. This meant customers who had their origins in multiple AWS accounts, had to keep their accounts in public subnets to get the scale and performance benefits of CloudFront. Customers then had to maintain additional security controls, such as access control lists (ACL), at both the edge and within regions, rather than benefiting from the inherent security of VPC origins. Now, customers can use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to allow CloudFront access to origins in private VPCs in different AWS accounts, both within and outside their AWS Organizations and organizational units (OUs). This streamlines security management and reduces operational complexity, making it easy to use CloudFront as the single front door for applications.\n  VPC origins is available in AWS Commercial Regions only, and the full list of supported AWS Regions is available here. There is no additional cost for using cross-account VPC origins with CloudFront. To learn more about implementing cross-account VPC origins and best practices for multi-account architectures, visit CloudFront VPC origins.",

This enhancement lets you seamlessly manage and discover cloud resources—such as Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon DynamoDB tables—across AWS accounts. By sharing your AWS Cloud Map namespace via AWS RAM, workloads in other accounts can discover and manage resources registered in that namespace. This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service discovery across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  You can now share your AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to maintain a centralized service registry—or a small set of registries—and share them across multiple accounts, simplifying service discovery. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. AWS Cloud Map's cross-account service discovery support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale service discovery as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to namespaces.\n  This feature is available now in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation.

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Service Connect now supports Envoy access logs, providing deeper observability into request-level traffic patterns and service interactions. This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.\n  You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and TCP). This feature is available in all regions where Amazon ECS Service Connect is supported.

This expansion enables customers with latency-sensitive payment applications to build, deploy or migrate into additional AWS Regions without depending on cross-region support. For customers processing payment workloads in Europe, availability in London offers additional options for multi-Region high availability.\n  AWS Payment Cryptography is a fully managed service that simplifies payment-specific cryptographic operations and key management for cloud-hosted payment applications. The service scales elastically with your business needs and is assessed as compliant with PCI PIN and PCI P2PE requirements, eliminating the need to maintain dedicated payment HSM instances. Organizations performing payment functions - including acquirers, payment facilitators, networks, switches, processors, and banks can now position their payment cryptographic operations closer to their applications while reducing dependencies on auxiliary data centers with dedicated payment HSMs.\n  AWS Payment Cryptography is available in the following AWS Regions: Canada(Montreal), US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland, Frankfurt, London), Africa(Cape Town) and Asia Pacific (Singapore, Tokyo, Osaka, Mumbai).\n  To start using the service, please download the latest AWS CLI/SDK and see the AWS Payment Cryptography user guide for more information.",
