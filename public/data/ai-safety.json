Real-time inference workloads require automatic scaling to address unpredictable traffic patterns and maintain service level agreements, while optimizing costs. However, organizations often struggle with the operational overhead of installing, configuring, and maintaining complex autoscaling solutions. HyperPod-managed node autoscaling eliminates the undifferentiated heavy lifting of Karpenter setup and maintenance, while providing integrated resilience and fault tolerance capabilities.\n  Autoscaling on HyperPod with Karpenter enables customers to achieve just-in-time provisioning that rapidly adapts GPU compute for inference traffic spikes. Customers can scale to zero nodes during low-demand periods without maintaining dedicated controller infrastructure and benefit from workload-aware node selection that optimizes instance types and costs. For inference workloads, this provides automatic capacity scaling to handle production traffic bursts, cost reduction through intelligent node consolidation during idle periods, and seamless integration with event-driven pod autoscalers like KEDA. Training workloads also benefit from automatic resource optimization during model development cycles. You can enable autoscaling on HyperPod using the UpdateCluster API with AutoScaling mode set to \"Enable\" and AutoScalerType set to \"Karpenter\".\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod EKS clusters are supported.

It specifically demonstrates how organizations can enable Snowflake to access tables in AWS Glue Data Catalog (stored in S3 buckets) through SageMaker Lakehouse Iceberg REST Catalog, with security managed by AWS Lake Formation. The post provides a detailed technical walkthrough of implementing this integration, including creating IAM roles and policies, configuring Lake Formation access controls, setting up catalog integration in Snowflake, and managing data access permissions. While four different patterns exist for accessing Iceberg tables from Snowflake, the blog focuses on the first pattern using catalog integration with SigV4 authentication and Lake Formation credential vending.",

With this launch, the account state, a new State field replaced the existing account status, Status field in the AWS Organizations Console, however both Status and State fields will remain available in the APIs until September 9, 2026.\n  This launch allows you to have a more granular account state information such as, 'SUSPENDED' for AWS-enforced suspension, 'PENDING_CLOSURE' for in-process closure requests, and 'CLOSED' for accounts in their 90-day reinstatement window, and more. After September, 2026 the Status field will be fully deprecated. Customers using account vending pipelines should update their implementations to reference the State field before the Status field deprecation date. This feature is available in all AWS commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To get started managing your accounts, please see the blog post and documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon ECS Service Connect now supports seamless communication between services residing in different AWS accounts through integration with AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service-to-service communication across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect leverages AWS Cloud Map namespaces for storing information about ECS services and tasks. To enable seamless cross-account communication between Amazon ECS Service Connect services, you can now share the underlying AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to use the same namespace to register Amazon ECS Service Connect services residing in multiple AWS accounts, simplifying service discovery and connectivity. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. Cross-account connectivity support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale Amazon ECS workloads as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to common services.\n \nThis feature is available with both Fargate and EC2 launch modes now in all commercial AWS Regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation. To learn more, please refer to the Amazon ECS Service Connect documentation.",

Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes.
