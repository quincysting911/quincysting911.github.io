      "description": "AWS Cloud Map now supports cross-account service discovery through integration with AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This enhancement lets you seamlessly manage and discover cloud resources—such as Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon DynamoDB tables—across AWS accounts. By sharing your AWS Cloud Map namespace via AWS RAM, workloads in other accounts can discover and manage resources registered in that namespace. This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service discovery across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  You can now share your AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to maintain a centralized service registry—or a small set of registries—and share them across multiple accounts, simplifying service discovery. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. AWS Cloud Map's cross-account service discovery support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale service discovery as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to namespaces.\n  This feature is available now in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation. To learn more, please refer to the AWS Cloud Map documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Service Connect now supports Envoy access logs, providing deeper observability into request-level traffic patterns and service interactions. This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.\n  You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and TCP). This feature is available in all regions where Amazon ECS Service Connect is supported.

      "description": "Today, Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) added visibility into the IP addresses used by Dedicated IP Addresses - Managed (DIP-M) pools. Customers can now find out the exact addresses in use when sending emails through DIP-M pools to mailbox providers. Customers can also see Microsoft Smart Network Data Services (SNDS) metrics for these IP addresses, giving them more insight into their sending reputation with Microsoft mailbox providers. This gives customers more transparency into the IP activities in DIP-M pools.\n  Previously, customers could configure DIP-M pools to perform automatic IP allocation and warm-up in response to changes in email sending volumes. This reduced the operational overhead of managing dedicated sending channels, but customers could not easily see which IP addresses were in use by DIP-M pools. This also made it difficult to find SNDS feedback, which customers use to improve their reputation. Now, customers can see the IPs in DIP-M pools through the console, CLI, or SES API. SES also automatically creates CloudWatch Metrics for SNDS information on each IP address, which customers can access through the CloudWatch console or APIs. This gives customers more tools to monitor their sending reputation.\n  SES supports DIP-M IP observability in all AWS Regions where SES is available.\n  For more information, see the documentation for information about DIP-M pools.",

This allows you to define IAM policies using tag-based access conditions, resulting in improved governance and security consistency.\n  Please refer to RDS and Aurora documentation to get started with defining IAM policies with tag-based access control on database and per-query metrics. This feature is available in all AWS regions where CloudWatch Database Insights is available.\n  CloudWatch Database Insights delivers database health monitoring aggregated at the fleet level, as well as instance-level dashboards for detailed database and SQL query analysis.

This feature introduces a new patch state called \"AvailableSecurityUpdate\" that reports security patches of all severity levels that are available to install on Windows instances but do not meet the approval rules in your patch baseline.\n  As organizations grow, administrators need to maintain secure systems while controlling when patches are applied. The security updates notification helps prevent situations where customers could unintentionally leave instances unpatched when using features like ApprovalDelay with large values. By default, instances with available security updates are marked as Non-Compliant, providing a clear signal that security patches require attention. Customers can also configure this behavior through their patch baseline settings to maintain existing compliance reporting if preferred.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Systems Manager is available. To get started with security updates notification for Windows patching compliance, visit the AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager console. For more information about this feature, refer to our user documentation or update your patch baseline with the details here. There are no additional charges for using this feature beyond standard AWS Systems Manager pricing.",

Automated Reasoning checks in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is the first and only generative AI safeguard that helps correct factual errors from hallucinations using logically accurate and verifiable reasoning that explains why responses are correct.\n  This feature enables organizations in regulated industries like healthcare, financial services, and government to adopt Automated Reasoning checks while meeting compliance requirements for customer-owned encryption keys. For example, a financial institution can now use Automated Reasoning checks to validate loan processing guidelines while maintaining full control over the encryption keys protecting their policy content. When creating an Automated Reasoning policy, you can now select a customer managed KMS key to encrypt your content rather than using the default key.\n  Customer managed KMS key support for Automated Reasoning checks is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Guardrails is offered: US East (N.
