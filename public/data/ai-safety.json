      "description": "AWS Backup now supports AWS PrivateLink for SAP HANA systems running on Amazon EC2. This enables customers to route all backup traffic through private network connections without traversing the public internet, helping organizations meet security and compliance requirements for regulated workloads.\n \nCustomers in regulated industries such as financial services, healthcare, and government agencies often require that all traffic remain on private networks. Previously, while SAP HANA application workloads could use AWS PrivateLink for secure, private communication with AWS services, backup traffic to AWS Backup had to traverse public endpoints. With this release, you can now use AWS PrivateLink for AWS Backup storage endpoints, ensuring your SAP HANA workloads on EC2 maintain end-to-end private connectivity for both application traffic and backup data. This helps organizations subject to HIPAA, EU/US Privacy Shield, and PCI DSS regulations implement fully private data protection strategies.\n \nThis feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Backup supports SAP HANA databases on EC2. To get started, update your Backint agent and add the backup-storage VPCE to your VPC.",

This release also includes new extension pg_stat_monitor that enables you to collect performance metrics and evaluate query performance insights in a unified view.\n  You can upgrade your databases during scheduled maintenance windows using automatic minor version upgrades. To simplify operations at scale, enable automatic minor version upgrades and use the AWS Organizations Upgrade Rollout Policy to orchestrate thousands of upgrades in phases, first to development environments before upgrading production systems. You can also use Amazon RDS Blue/Green deployments with physical replication to minimize downtime for minor version upgrades.\n  Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale PostgreSQL deployments in the cloud.

      "description": "Today, AWS Payment Cryptography has become one of the first cloud-based payment cryptography services to obtain approval from Groupement des Cartes Bancaires (CB), France's national card payment network. This CB approval, combined with existing compliance credentials, enables customers to run payment workloads in AWS while helping customers maintain CB compliance.\n  Organizations such as acquirers, payment facilitators, networks, switches, processors, and issuing banks that are moving workloads to the cloud can rely on AWS Payment Cryptography’s CB approval as part of their compliance frameworks. Organizations processing card payments typically require Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to perform cryptography in a compliant manner. AWS Payment Cryptography provides equivalent functionality in an elastic, scalable service, eliminating the operational burden of procuring and manage standalone payment HSMs. Customers can leverage the service’s shared responsibility model with PCI PIN, PCI P2PE, PCI 3DS, PCI DSS, SOC-2, CSA STAR and ISO27001 certifications as well as the additional CB approval.\n  AWS Payment Cryptography is available in the following AWS Regions: Canada (Montreal), US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Ireland, Frankfurt, London, Paris), Africa (Cape Town) and Asia Pacific (Singapore, Tokyo, Osaka, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Sydney).\n  To start using the service, please download the latest AWS CLI/SDK and see the AWS Payment Cryptography user guide for more information including further compliance details.",

This new capability delivers enhanced cost optimization through a shared compute model that reduces overall OCU expenses while maintaining collection-level security and access controls. Additionally, Collection Groups introduce the ability to specify minimum OCU allocations alongside maximum OCU limits, allowing you to provision compute capacity upfront at startup for more predictable performance.\n  Collection Groups are particularly valuable for multi-tenant workloads where different tenants require data encryption with separate KMS keys while still benefiting from shared compute resources. By grouping collections together, you can optimize OCU utilization across workloads, reduce costs through resource sharing, and maintain the security isolation required by different encryption keys. The minimum OCU setting ensures your collections have guaranteed baseline capacity from the moment they start, eliminating cold start delays and providing consistent performance for latency-sensitive applications.\n  Collection groups are available in all regions where Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is currently available.

This enhancement helps you monitor large-scale workloads more efficiently.\n  When you call the ListJobs API for Array Jobs, the response now includes a statusSummary field that shows the count of child jobs in each state: SUBMITTED, PENDING, RUNNABLE, STARTING, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, and FAILED. Previously, statusSummary field was only available in the response of DescribeJobs API call. Using the new field you can now monitor the progress of multiple array jobs in your queue with a single API call.. The response also includes a statusSummaryLastUpdatedAt timestamp, allowing you to assess the freshness of the status information. This transparency helps you make informed decisions about your workload management and troubleshooting.\n  This feature is particularly valuable for high-scale batch processing workloads in financial services, automotive, and other industries where monitoring thousands of parallel jobs is critical for operational visibility. Available today in all AWS Regions where AWS Batch is available. For more information, see the ListJobs API page in AWS Batch API Reference.",

With location mapping, dashboard authors can ensure their geospatial visuals correctly represent their data's geographical context, leading to more reliable insights. The feature provides clear status tracking with Unmatched, Matched, and Unused location indicators, helping users understand and manage their location mappings effectively.

      "description": "Amazon CloudFront announces support for mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for origins, a security protocol that enables customers to verify that requests to their origin servers come only from their authorized CloudFront distributions using TLS certificates. This certificate-based authentication provides cryptographic verification of CloudFront's identity, eliminating the need for customers to manage custom security controls.\n  Previously, verifying that requests came from CloudFront distributions required customers to build and maintain custom authentication solutions like shared secret headers or IP allow-lists, particularly for public or externally hosted origins. These approaches required ongoing operational overhead to rotate secrets, update allow-lists, and maintain custom code. Now with origin mTLS support, customers can implement a standardized, certificate-based authentication approach that eliminates this operational burden. This enables organizations to enforce strict authentication for their proprietary content, ensuring that only verified CloudFront distributions can establish connections to backend infrastructure ranging from AWS origins and on-premises servers to third-party cloud providers and external CDNs. Customers can leverage client certificates issued by AWS Private Certificate Authority or third-party private Certificate Authorities, which they import through AWS Certificate Manager.\n  Customers can configure origin mTLS using the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDK, CDK, or CloudFormation. Origin mTLS is supported for all origins that support mutual TLS on AWS such as Application Load Balancer and API Gateway, as well as on-premises and custom origins. There is no additional charge for origin mTLS. Origin mTLS is also available in the Business and Premium flat-rate pricing plans. For detailed implementation guidance and best practices, visit the CloudFront origin mutual TLS documentation.",
