      "description": "AWS Organizations Tag Policies announces Reporting for Required Tags, a new validation check that proactively ensures your CloudFormation, Terraform, and Pulumi deployments include the required tags critical to your business. Your infrastructure-as-code (IaC) operations can now be automatically validated against tag policies to ensure tagging consistency across your AWS environments. With this, you can ensure compliance for your IaC deployments in two simple steps: 1) define your tag policy, and 2) enable validation in each IaC tool.\n  Tag Policies enables you to enforce consistent tagging across your AWS accounts with proactive compliance, governance, and control. With this launch, you can specify mandatory tag keys in your tag policies, and enforce guardrails for your IaC deployments. For example, you can define a tag policy that all EC2 instances in your IaC templates must have “Environment”, “Owner”, and “Application” as required tag keys. You can start validation by activating AWS::TagPolicies::TaggingComplianceValidator Hook in CloudFormation, adding validation logic in your Terraform plan, or activating aws-organizations-tag-policies pre-built policy pack in Pulumi. Once configured, all CloudFormation, Terraform, and Pulumi deployments in the target account will be automatically validated and/or enforced against your tag policies, ensuring that resources like EC2 instances include the required \"Environment\", \"Owner\", and \"Application\" tags.\n  You can use Reporting for Required Tags feature via AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS Software Development Kit. This feature is available with AWS Organizations Tag Policies in AWS Regions where Tag Policies is available. To learn more, visit Tag Policies documentation. To learn how to set up validation and enforcement, see the user guide for CloudFormation, this user guide for Terraform, and this blog post for Pulumi.",

This enhancement introduces full snapshot data ingestion for SAP entities that lack complete change data capture (CDC) functionality, while also providing incremental data loading capabilities for SAP entities that don't support the Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) framework. These new features work alongside existing capabilities for ODP-supported SAP entities, to give customers the flexibility to implement zero-ETL data ingestion strategies across diverse SAP environments.\n  Fully managed AWS zero-ETL integrations eliminate the engineering overhead associated with building custom ETL data pipelines. This new zero-ETL functionality enables organizations to ingest data from multiple SAP applications into Amazon Redshift or the lakehouse architecture of Amazon SageMaker to address scenarios where SAP entities lack deletion tracking flags or don't support the Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) framework. Through full snapshot ingestion for entities without deletion tracking and timestamp-based incremental loading for non-ODP systems, zero-ETL integrations reduce operational complexity while saving organizations weeks of engineering effort that would otherwise be required to design, build, and test custom data pipelines across diverse SAP application environments.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Glue zero-ETL is currently available.\n  To get started with the enhanced zero-ETL coverage for SAP sources refer to the AWS Glue zero-ETL user guide.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudFront now supports CBOR Web Tokens (CWT) and Common Access Tokens (CAT), enabling secure token-based authentication and authorization with CloudFront Functions at CloudFront edge locations. CWT provides a compact, binary alternative to JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) encoding, while CAT extends CWT with additional fine grained access control including URL patterns, IP restrictions, and HTTP method limitations. Both token types use CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) for enhanced security and allow developers to implement lightweight, high-performance authentication mechanisms directly at the edge with sub-millisecond execution times.\n  CWT and CAT are ideal for performance critical applications such as live video streaming platforms that need to validate viewer access tokens millions of times per second, or IoT applications where bandwidth efficiency is crucial. These tokens also provide a single, standardized method for content authentication across multi-CDN deployments, simplifying security management and preventing the need for unique configurations for each CDN provider. For example, a media company can use CAT to create tokens that restrict access to specific video content based on subscription tiers, geographic location, and device types, all validated consistently across CloudFront and other CDN providers without requiring application network calls. With CWT and CAT support, you can validate incoming tokens, generate new tokens, and implement token refresh logic within CloudFront Functions. The feature integrates seamlessly with CloudFront Functions KeyValueStore for secure key management.\n  CWT and CAT support for CloudFront Functions is available at no additional charge in all CloudFront edge locations. To learn more about CloudFront Functions CBOR Web Token support, see the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling announced a new strategy, ReplaceRootVolume, within instance refresh. This feature allows customers to update the root volume of an EC2 instance without stopping or terminating the instance, while preserving other associated instance resources. The capability reduces operational complexity, simplifies software patching, and streamlines recovery from corrupted root volumes.\n  Customers use instance refresh to update the instances in their Auto Scaling groups (ASGs). This feature can be useful when customers want to migrate their instances to new instance types to take advantage of the latest improvements and optimizations. Traditionally, this process involved terminating older instances and launching new ones in a controlled manner. The new ReplaceRootVolume strategy transforms how customers manage instance lifecycles and software updates in their ASGs by enabling EC2 Auto Scaling service to replace the root Amazon EBS volume for running instances without stopping them. Organizations can now implement OS-level updates and security patches more efficiently without worrying about capacity management. This is especially valuable for workloads that use specialized instance types like Mac or GPU instances. Customers with stateful applications can now refresh their fleets with more confidence that their instances data, metadata, and attachments (such as network interfaces and elastic IPs) will be preserved with the new ReplaceRootVolume strategy.\n  This feature is now available in US East (N.

Customers can now configure a way to retain their instances when their termination lifecycle hooks fail or timeout, providing greater confidence in managing instances for graceful shutdown.\n  You can add lifecycle hooks to an Auto Scaling group (ASG) to perform custom actions when an instance enters a wait state. You can choose a target service (e.g., Amazon EventBridge or AWS Lambda) to perform these actions depending on your preferred development approach. Customers use ASG lifecycle hooks to save application state, properly close database connections, back up important data from local storage, delete sensitive data/credentials, or deregister from service discovery before instance termination. Previously, both default results—continue and abandon—led to ASG terminating instances when the lifecycle hook timeout elapsed or if an unexpected failure occurred. With the new instance lifecycle policy, you can now configure retention-triggers to keep your instances in a retained state for manual intervention until you're ready to terminate them again. This policy provides greater confidence in graceful instance termination and is especially helpful for stateful applications running on ASG.\n  This feature is now available in US East (N.

With this new capability, you can centrally configure and manage scan types—such as Amazon EC2 scanning, ECR scanning, Lambda standard and Code Scanning, and Code Security — across all the accounts in your organization, selected organizational units (OUs), or individual accounts. The new Inspector policy type within AWS Organization simplifies your service onboarding, management, and ensures consistent, organization-wide vulnerability scanning coverage.\n  This feature helps you maintain a uniform security baseline by automating Inspector enablement through a single AWS Organization policy. To get started, designate a delegated admin within Amazon Inspector, enable the “Inspector policies” policy type in the AWS Organizations console, and create a policy that specifies the desired scan types and Regions. Once attached to your organization root or OUs, Inspector will automatically be enabled for all the specified scan-types across covered accounts . When the Inspector policy is created and attached, all in-scope accounts automatically are aligned with your Organization-wide policy definition. New accounts that join the organization or are moved into an OU with an attached policy, inherit Inspector enablement automatically—reducing operational overhead and eliminating coverage gaps.\n  Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans AWS workloads including Amazon EC2 instances, container images, AWS Lambda functions, and code repositories for software vulnerabilities, code vulnerabilities, and unintended network exposure across your entire AWS organization.

To protect proprietary pricing information, Billing Transfer is integrated with AWS Billing Conductor. This integration enables billing administrators to control how the cost data will be seen by their AWS organizations and implement advanced cost allocation strategies across multiple AWS organizations. For AWS Billing Transfer customers, there is no cost to use AWS Billing Conductor when they choose an AWS managed pricing plan. If they choose a Customer managed pricing plan, there will be a fee of $50 per AWS Organization. AWS offers a free trial for Billing Transfer through May 31, 2026. During this period, both AWS managed and Customer managed pricing plans in Billing Conductor are available at no charge. Starting June 1, 2026, Billing Transfer customers will be charged by the number of AWS organizations with Customer managed pricing plan attached to it.\n \nIf you’re using Billing Conductor on its own without Billing Transfer, you will still follow the standard per-account pricing model regardless of the type of pricing plan used (see pricing details).\n \nBilling Transfer is available today in all public AWS Regions, excluding the GovCloud, China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia) Regions.\n To learn more about using Billing Transfer to centralize billing and cost management across your multi-organization environment, visit Billing Transfer product page, AWS Billing documentation, AWS Cost Management documentation, and news blog.",

Portals solve the challenge of fragmented APIs by automatically discovering existing APIs across accounts, generating documentation and also allow custom documentation. Teams can organize APIs into logical products for different audiences, customize branding by attaching company logos, configure access controls, ensure API compliance with organizational standards, and use analytics for understanding user engagement. Users can benefit from discovery and \"Try It\" button for API exploration.\n  Portals deliver three benefits that address the pressing challenges in API management today. They eliminate the security risks of third-party solutions by keeping all API configurations within AWS boundaries while providing access control for internal and external audiences. Portals also reduce developer onboarding time from weeks to minutes through automated portal generation, and documentation that updates as APIs evolve. This eliminates the weeks of infrastructure setup and also promotes re-use across developer teams. Portals also provide visibility into developer portal usage and analytics, through CloudWatch RUM (Real User Monitoring) making it easier to understand user engagement.\n  To learn about pricing for this feature, please see the Amazon API Gateway pricing page.

      "description": "AWS Cost Anomaly Detection now enables you to monitor all linked accounts, cost allocation tags, or cost categories with a single managed monitor. Previously available only for AWS services, this capability helps you identify unusual spending patterns across your entire AWS organization without manual configuration.\n  As organizations scale, you need visibility into costs for individual accounts, teams, or business units to maintain accountability and quickly identify anomalies. For example, if you track 500 application teams using a 'team' cost allocation tag, you previously needed to create and maintain 500 individual monitors. Now, you can create a single managed monitor that automatically tracks each team's spending separately. When your organization evolves—such as 'team-mobile' splitting into 'team-ios' and 'team-android'—both new teams are automatically monitored individually without any configuration changes, ensuring continuous anomaly detection as your organization grows.\n  The extension of AWS managed monitors to linked accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories is available today in all commercial AWS Regions at no additional charge.\n  To learn more, visit AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, or read our blog post.

This new capability streamlines the process of transferring accounts between organizations, whether those transfers are part of ongoing operations or an acquisition integration project.\n \nAllowing direct transfers of accounts between organizations eliminates the previous requirement for the account to temporarily operate as a standalone account. With the standalone step removed, customers no longer need to manually configure the account's payment method, contact information, and support plan as part of the transfer. Direct transfers of accounts also ensure the account maintains access to the governance features and consolidated billing benefits of the AWS organization they are in before and after the transfer process. The updated process is simpler and uses the same AWS Organizations console experience and APIs as before: an organization invites an account, and the account accepts the invite.\n \nDirect account transfers between organizations are now available in all commercial AWS Regions and the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.\n \nTo learn more about directly transferring accounts between AWS organizations, see Managing account invitations with AWS Organizations from the AWS user guide, or review the AWS Organizations API Reference.",

Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
