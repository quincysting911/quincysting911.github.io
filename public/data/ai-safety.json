      "description": "Amazon Quick Suite now includes Quick Research as a step within Quick Flows. This integration enables teams to generate comprehensive research reports as part of automated, multi-step workflows, transforming research projects into reusable workflows that can be shared across their organization.\n  Quick Suite is Amazon's new AI-powered workspace that helps organizations get answers from their business data and move quickly from insights to action. With this integration, teams can trigger research automatically within their flows rather than conducting separate analysis. This addresses a critical productivity challenge by enabling teams to capture and scale proven research methods across hundreds of automated use cases. The integration also allows users to automate research workflows through scheduled triggers so users can set up flows that automatically generate research at specific times. Common use cases include automated account plan creation, standardizing product compliance analysis, and scheduled industry reports.\n  Users benefit from pre-configured flows that generate research based on flow creator instructions and optional user inputs. The generated research report can be used further to automatically trigger downstream actions like updating a Salesforce opportunity for an account team to follow up on, posting on a Jira ticket for a compliance team to review, or creating an Asana task for a patent lawyer to approve. This unlocks \"set and forget\" workflows that deliver consistent analysis without manual heavy lifting. Now operating within these automated workflows, Quick Research maintains its core strength of streamlining analysis across diverse enterprise data sources while delivering verified, source-traced insights. For existing Flow users, this provides access to more comprehensive analysis.\n  Quick Research with Flows integration is available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Europe (Ireland). To learn more about automating your research needs, read the Quick Suite user guide.",

      "description": "Amazon S3 Storage Lens provides organization-wide visibility into your storage usage and activity to help optimize costs, improve performance, and strengthen data protection. Today, we are adding three new capabilities to S3 Storage Lens that give you deeper insights into your S3 storage usage and application performance: performance metrics that provide insights into how your applications interact with S3 data, analytics for billions of prefixes in your buckets, and metrics export directly to S3 Tables for easier querying and analysis.\n  We are adding three specific types of performance metrics. Access pattern metrics identify inefficient requests, including those that are too small and create unnecessary network overhead. Request origin metrics, such as cross-Region request counts, show when applications access data across regions, impacting latency and costs. Object access count metrics reveal when applications frequently read a small subset of objects that could be optimized through caching or moving to high-performance storage.\n  We are expanding the prefix analytics in S3 Storage Lens to enable analyzing billions of prefixes per bucket, whereas previously metrics were limited to the largest prefixes that met minimum size and depth thresholds. This gives you visibility into storage usage and activity across all your prefixes. Finally, we are making it possible to export metrics directly to managed S3 Tables, making them immediately available for querying with AWS analytics services like Amazon QuickSight and enabling you to join this data with other AWS service data for deeper insights.\n  To get started, enable performance metrics or expanded prefixes in your S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics dashboard configuration. These capabilities are available in all AWS Regions, except for AWS China Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. You can enable metrics export to managed S3 Tables in both free and advanced dashboard configurations in AWS Regions where S3 Tables are available.

S3 Vectors delivers purpose-built, cost-optimized vector storage for AI agents, inference, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and semantic search at billion-vector scale. S3 Vectors is designed to provide the same elasticity, durability, and availability as Amazon S3 and reduces the total costs to upload, store, and query vectors by up to 90%. With general availability, you can store and query up to two billion vectors per index and elastically scale to 10,000 vector indexes per vector bucket. Infrequent queries continue to return results in under one second, with more frequent queries now resulting in latencies around 100 milliseconds or less. Your application can achieve write throughput of 1,000 vectors per second when streaming single-vector updates into your indexes, retrieve up to 100 search results per query, and store up to 50 metadata keys alongside each vector for fine-grained filtering in your queries.\n \nWith S3 Vectors you get a new bucket type—a vector bucket—that is optimized for durable, low-cost vector storage. Within vector buckets, you organize your vector data with vector indexes and get a dedicated set of APIs to store, access, and query vectors without provisioning any infrastructure. By default, S3 Vectors encrypts all vector data in a vector bucket with server-side encryption using S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or optionally, you can use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) to set a default customer-managed key to encrypt all new vector indexes in the vector bucket. You can now also set a dedicated customer-managed key per vector index, helping you build scalable multi-tenant applications and meet regulatory and governance requirements. You can also tag vector buckets and indexes for attribute-based access control (ABAC) as well as to track and organize costs using AWS Billing and Cost Management.\n \nS3 Vectors integrates with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to reduce the cost of using large vector datasets for RAG. When creating a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio, you can choose an existing Amazon S3 vector index or create a new one using the Quick Create workflow. With Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can optimize costs for hybrid search workloads by configuring OpenSearch to automatically manage vector storage in S3.\n \nS3 Vectors is now generally available in 14 AWS Regions, expanding from 5 Regions in preview. To learn more, visit the product page, S3 pricing page, documentation, and AWS News blog.",

AWS Transform is the first agentic AI service to accelerate the transformation of Windows, mainframe, VMware, and more—reducing technical debt and making your tech stack AI-ready. Technical debt accumulates when organizations maintain legacy systems and outdated code, requiring them to allocate 20-30% of their software development resources to repeatable, cross-codebase transformation tasks that must be performed manually. AWS Transform can automate repeatable transformations of version upgrades, runtime migrations, framework transitions, and language translations at scale, reducing execution time by over 80% in many cases while eliminating the need for specialized automation expertise.\n \nThe custom transformation agent in AWS Transform provides both pre-built and custom solutions. It includes out-of-the-box transformations for common scenarios, such as Python and Node.js runtime upgrades, Lambda function modernization, AWS SDK updates across multiple languages, and Java 8 to 17 upgrades (supporting any build system including Gradle and Maven). For organization-specific needs, teams can define custom transformations using natural language, reference documents, and code samples. Users can trigger autonomous transformations with a simple one-line CLI command, which can be scripted or embedded into any existing pipeline or workflow. Within your organization, the agent continually learns from developer feedback and execution results, improving transformation accuracy and tightly aligning the agent’s performance with your organization’s preferences. This approach enables organizations to systematically address technical debt at scale, with the agent continually improving while developers can focus on innovation and high-impact tasks.\n \nAWS Transform custom is now available in the US East (N.

      "description": "AWS announces important configuration updates coming July 31st, 2025, affecting AWS SDKs and CLIs default settings. Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
