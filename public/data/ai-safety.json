      "description": "Today, we’re announcing the integration of Amazon Neptune Database with GraphStorm, a scalable, open-source graph machine learning (ML) library built for enterprise-scale applications. This brings together Neptune’s OLTP (Online transaction processing) graph capabilities with GraphStorm’s scalable inference engine, making it easier for customers to deploy graph ML in latency-sensitive, transactional environments.\n  With this integration, developers can train GNN models using GraphStorm and deploy them as real-time inference endpoints that directly query Neptune for subgraph neighborhoods on demand. Predictions—such as node classifications or link predictions—can then be returned in sub-second timeframes, closing the loop between transactional graph updates and ML-driven decisions. This integration unlocks use cases such as fraud detection and prevention, where organizations can make real-time decisions based on complex relationships among accounts, devices, and transactions; dynamic recommendations, where systems can instantly adapt to user behavior using live graph context; and graph-based risk scoring, where risk assessments are continuously updated as the graph evolves. Customers can also combine real-time inference results with graph analytics queries for deeper operational insights, enabling ML feedback loops directly within graph applications.\n  This feature is available in all regions where Amazon Neptune Database is available.

With this feature, administrators can create more granular IAM policies and service control policies (SCPs) to restrict configurations for Transfer Family resources, enhancing security controls and compliance management. \n \nIAM condition keys allow you to author policies that enforce access control based on API request context. With these new condition keys, you can now author policies based on Transfer Family context to control which protocols, endpoint types, and storage domains can be configured through policy conditions. For example, you can use transfer:RequestServerEndpointType to prevent the creation of public servers, or transfer:RequestServerProtocols to ensure only SFTP servers can be created, enabling you to define additional permission guardrails for Transfer Family actions. \n  The new IAM condition keys are available in all AWS Regions where AWS Transfer Family is available. To learn more, visit the IAM Service Authorization Reference and Transfer Family User Guide. To learn more about how to manage permissions within your organization through SCPs, visit the AWS Organizations User Guide.",

      "description": "Starting today, customers can use boot and data volumes backed by Dell PowerStore and HPE Alletra Storage MP B10000 storage arrays with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances on AWS Outposts, including authenticated and encrypted volumes. This enhancement extends our existing support for boot and data volumes to include Dell and HPE storage arrays, alongside our current support for NetApp® on-premises enterprise storage arrays and Pure Storage® FlashArray™. Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience.\n  With Outposts, customers can maximize the value of their on-premises storage investments by leveraging their existing enterprise storage arrays for both boot and data volumes, complementing managed Amazon EBS and Local Instance Store options. This provides significant operational benefits, including streamlined operating system (OS) management via centralized boot volumes and advanced data management features through high-performance data volumes. By integrating their own storage, organizations can also satisfy data residency requirements and benefit from a consistent cloud operational model for their hybrid environments.\n  To simplify the process, AWS offers automation scripts through AWS Samples to help customers easily set up and use external block volumes with EC2 instances on Outposts. Customers can use the AWS Management Console or CLI to utilize third-party block volumes with EC2 instances on Outposts.\n  Third-party storage integration for Outposts with all compatible storage vendors is available on Outposts 2U servers and Outposts racks at no additional charge in all AWS Regions where Outposts is supported. See the FAQs for Outposts servers and Outposts racks for the latest list of supported Regions.\n  To learn more about implementation details and best practices, check out this blog post or visit our technical documentation for Outposts servers, second-generation Outposts racks, and first-generation Outposts racks.",

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) now supports running tasks in IPv6-only subnets. With this launch, Amazon ECS tasks and services can run using only IPv6 addresses, without requiring IPv4. This enables customers to deploy containerized applications in IPv6-only environments, scale without being limited by IPv4 address availability, and meet IPv6 compliance requirements through native IPv6 support in Amazon ECS.\n  Previously, Amazon ECS tasks always required an IPv4 address, even when launched in dual-stack subnets. This requirement could create scaling and management challenges for customers operating large fleets of containerized applications, where IPv4 address space became a bottleneck. With IPv6-only support, Amazon ECS tasks launched in IPv6-only subnets use only IPv6 addresses. This removes IPv4 as a dependency and helps organizations that must meet IPv6 adoption or regulatory mandates.\n  The feature works across all Amazon ECS launch types and can be used with awsvpc, bridge, and host networking modes. To get started, create IPv6-only subnets in your VPC and launch Amazon ECS services or tasks in those subnets. Amazon ECS automatically detects the configuration and provisions the appropriate networking. To learn more about IPv6-only task networking and supported AWS Regions, see the Amazon ECS task networking documentation for AWS Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type.
