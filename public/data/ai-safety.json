You can optimize storage costs by identifying prefixes with incomplete multipart uploads or buckets accumulating non-current object versions. You can identify buckets that don’t follow your data protection best practices, such as using S3 Cross-Region Replication to replicate data across AWS Regions or S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object. With the newly added performance metrics, you can identify application performance constraints—for example, using request and object size distribution metrics to detect inefficient access patterns or tracking cross-Region data transfer to reduce latency and costs.\n  Amazon S3 Storage Lens is available in all AWS Regions. S3 Storage Lens is pre-configured to receive free metrics by default for all customers and 14 days of historical data. For more detailed visibility with up to 15 months data retention, you can upgrade to S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics.

AWS Transform custom helps organizations reduce technical debt by automating repetitive transformation tasks such as language version upgrades, API migrations, and framework updates. The agent is designed for enterprise development teams and consulting partners who need to execute consistent, repeatable code transformations across large codebases.\n  With AWS Transform custom, teams can create custom transformation definitions using natural language, documentation, and code samples, or use AWS-managed transformations for common scenarios including Java, Python, and Node.js version upgrades. Through continual learning, the service improves transformation quality with every execution over time. With AWS PrivateLink support, customers can now access AWS Transform custom from their Amazon VPC without routing traffic over the public internet, helping meet security and compliance requirements.\n  To learn more about AWS Transform custom, visit the product page and user guide.",

As organizations navigate newly adopted AI agents and work with existing enterprise tools for CRM, support, collaboration, and more, users face fragmented experiences. Users are forced to switch between different interfaces, repeat context, and manually stitch together outputs. Quick enables users to work with third-party agents and enterprise tools from a single interface, eliminating the wasted time and cognitive load of constantly switching between applications.\n  With Quick, business users can now invoke specialized agents from Box, Canva, and PagerDuty to accomplish chat and automation tasks. For example, you can pull incident insights from PagerDuty, generate a presentation in Canva, and query documents stored in Box - all directly from Quick. Additionally, Quick has expanded its built-in actions to include integrations with GitHub, Notion, Canva, Box, Linear, Hugging Face, Monday.com, HubSpot, Intercom, and more. This enables Quick users to accomplish tasks like creating GitHub issues, summarizing meeting notes in Notion, managing their CRM, and more. Beyond our new built-in integrations, customers can continue to leverage custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) and OpenAPI connectors to connect Quick to thousands of additional applications.\n  These features are now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Quick is available. To learn more, visit the Amazon Quick Supported Integrations Guide and Integration Specific Guide.",

The new Quickstart setup, reduces the number of steps required to set up an Client VPN endpoint. You can now easily set up Client VPN endpoints with pre-defined default configurations, requiring only three key inputs: IPv4 CIDR, server certificate ARN, and subnet selection. For example, development teams in large organizations who use Client VPN for remote access to their VPC resources for quick testing can now create endpoints quickly with the new simplified setup process.\n  The Quickstart method is available alongside the existing Standard Setup option, giving you the flexibility to choose the approach that best fits your deployment needs. Additionally, when you create a VPC, the Client VPN Quickstart workflow is automatically suggested as a follow up step. Once endpoint creation is complete, you can immediately download the client configuration file to connect using your VPN client. You can later modify and enhance your endpoint configuration using the Client VPN standard console or API as your usage patterns evolve. This enhancement is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where AWS Client VPN is generally available.\n  To learn more about Client VPN:\n  \n \n \nVisit the AWS Client VPN product page\n \n \nRead the AWS Client VPN documentation",

With tmpfs, you can now create memory‑backed file systems for your containerized workloads without writing this data to task storage.\n  tmpfs mounts provide a temporary file system that is backed by memory and exposed inside the container at a path you choose. This is ideal for performance‑sensitive workloads that need fast access to scratch files, caches, or temporary working sets, and for security‑sensitive data such as short‑lived secrets or credentials, because the data does not persist after the task stops. tmpfs also lets you keep the container root file system read‑only using the readonlyRootFilesystem setting while still allowing applications to write to specific in‑memory directories.\n  To get started, update your task definition so that the container definitions include a linuxParameters block with one or more tmpfs entries. For each tmpfs mount, specify the containerPath, size, and optional mountOptions. You can register or update task definitions using the Amazon ECS console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS CDK. This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon ECS, AWS Fargate, and Amazon ECS Managed Instances are supported.

      "title": "Updating AWS SDK defaults – AWS STS service endpoint and Retry Strategy",
      "description": "AWS announces important configuration updates coming July 31st, 2025, affecting AWS SDKs and CLIs default settings. Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
