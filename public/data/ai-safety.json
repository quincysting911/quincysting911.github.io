You can now use AWS Backup to help protect your entire EKS environments through a centralized, policy-driven backup service.\n  You now get comprehensive data protection capabilities through AWS Backup across your Amazon EKS Clusters, including automated scheduling, retention management, immutable vaults, cross-Region and cross-account copies. AWS Backup delivers a new an agent-free solution that works natively with AWS, replacing custom scripts or third-party tools to perform backups for each cluster. You can restore entire EKS clusters, specific namespaces, or individual persistent volumes. Use AWS Backup to protect your clusters for disaster recovery, to help meet your compliance requirements, or for additional protection before EKS cluster upgrades.\n  AWS Backup for EKS is available in all AWS Regions where both AWS Backup and Amazon EKS are available.

      "description": "AWS Control Tower customers can now simply move their accounts to an Organizational Unit (OU) to enroll them under AWS Control Tower governance. This feature helps customers maintain consistency across their AWS environment and simplifies the account creation and enrollment processes. When enrolled, member accounts receive best practice configurations, controls, and baseline resources required for AWS Control Tower governance.\n  Customers are no longer required to manually update accounts or re-register OUs when migrating accounts or making changes to their OU structure. When an account is moved to a new OU, AWS Control Tower automatically enrolls the account, applying the baseline configurations and controls from the new OU and removing those from the original OU. With this feature, customers can further simplify their new account provisioning workflows by creating an account and then moving it into the right OU using the AWS Organizations console or the CreateAccount and MoveAccount APIs.\n  Customers on landing zone version 3.1 and higher can opt in to this feature by toggling the automatically enroll accounts flag in their Landing Zone settings or using the Create or UpdateLandingZone APIs by setting the value of the RemediationTypes parameter to Inheritance_Drift. To learn more about this functionality, review Move and enroll accounts with auto-enrollment. For a list of AWS Regions where AWS Control Tower is available, see the AWS Region Table.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudFront announces cross-account support for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) origins, enabling customers to access VPC origins that reside in different AWS accounts from their CloudFront distributions. With VPC origins, customers can have their Application Load Balancers (ALB), Network Load Balancers (NLB), and EC2 Instances in a private subnet that is accessible only through their CloudFront distributions. With the support for cross-account VPC origins in CloudFront, customers can now leverage the security benefits of VPC origins while maintaining their existing multi-account architecture.\n  Customers set up multiple AWS accounts for better security isolation, cost management, and compliance. Previously, customers could access origins in private VPCs from CloudFront only if CloudFront and the origin were in the same AWS account. This meant customers who had their origins in multiple AWS accounts, had to keep their accounts in public subnets to get the scale and performance benefits of CloudFront. Customers then had to maintain additional security controls, such as access control lists (ACL), at both the edge and within regions, rather than benefiting from the inherent security of VPC origins. Now, customers can use AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) to allow CloudFront access to origins in private VPCs in different AWS accounts, both within and outside their AWS Organizations and organizational units (OUs). This streamlines security management and reduces operational complexity, making it easy to use CloudFront as the single front door for applications.\n  VPC origins is available in AWS Commercial Regions only, and the full list of supported AWS Regions is available here. There is no additional cost for using cross-account VPC origins with CloudFront.

      "description": "AWS Cloud Map now supports cross-account service discovery through integration with AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) in AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. This enhancement lets you seamlessly manage and discover cloud resources—such as Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon EC2 instances, and Amazon DynamoDB tables—across AWS accounts. By sharing your AWS Cloud Map namespace via AWS RAM, workloads in other accounts can discover and manage resources registered in that namespace. This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service discovery across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  You can now share your AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to maintain a centralized service registry—or a small set of registries—and share them across multiple accounts, simplifying service discovery. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. AWS Cloud Map's cross-account service discovery support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale service discovery as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to namespaces.\n  This feature is available now in the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation. To learn more, please refer to the AWS Cloud Map documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) Service Connect now supports Envoy access logs, providing deeper observability into request-level traffic patterns and service interactions. This new capability captures detailed per-request telemetry for end-to-end tracing, debugging, and compliance monitoring.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect makes it simple to build secure, resilient service-to-service communication across clusters, VPCs, and AWS accounts. It integrates service discovery and service mesh capabilities by automatically injecting AWS-managed Envoy proxies as sidecars that handle traffic routing, load balancing, and inter-service connectivity. Envoy Access logs capture detailed traffic metadata enabling request-level visibility into service communication patterns. This enables you to perform network diagnostics, troubleshoot issues efficiently, and maintain audit trails for compliance requirements.\n  You can now configure access logs within ECS Service Connect by updating the ServiceConnectConfiguration to enable access logging. Query strings are redacted by default to protect sensitive data. Envoy access logs will output to the standard output (STDOUT) stream alongside application logs and flow through the existing ECS log pipeline without requiring additional infrastructure. This configuration supports all existing application protocols (HTTP, HTTP2, GRPC and TCP). This feature is available in all regions where Amazon ECS Service Connect is supported.
