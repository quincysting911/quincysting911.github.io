      "description": "Amazon WorkSpaces Applications now offers enhanced flexibility features that provide customers with more choices for compute and configurable storage volume. Customers can also import their custom EC2 AMIs to create Amazon WorkSpaces images. These new capabilities help customers better match resources to their specific application requirements while optimizing costs.\n  The service now includes 100+ additional compute instance types and sizes across all supported instance families, including general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, and accelerated options. Customers can also customize storage volumes ranging from 200GB to 500GB, and utilize their own Microsoft Windows Server 2022 AMIs along with their preferred image customization tools.\n  With these enhancements, customers can now match their computing resources to exactly what their applications need while controlling costs effectively. Organizations can choose the right instance type for each use case - whether it's basic office applications running on cost-efficient general-purpose instances, or demanding CAD software requiring powerful compute-optimized instances. The ability to select storage size options allows customers to use additional storage based on their application needs. All of this customization is available while maintaining the simplicity of a fully managed service, eliminating the complexity of infrastructure management.\n  These new capabilities are now generally available in all AWS Regions where Amazon WorkSpaces Applications is supported. The enhanced features follow WorkSpaces Applications’ standard pay-as-you-go pricing model. For detailed pricing information, visit the Amazon WorkSpaces Applications Pricing page.

This enhancement simplifies resource sharing, reduces duplication, and promotes consistent service-to-service communication across environments for organizations with multi-account architectures.\n  Amazon ECS Service Connect leverages AWS Cloud Map namespaces for storing information about ECS services and tasks. To enable seamless cross-account communication between Amazon ECS Service Connect services, you can now share the underlying AWS Cloud Map namespaces using AWS RAM with individual AWS accounts, specific Organizational Units (OUs), or your entire AWS Organization. To get started, create a resource share in AWS RAM, add the namespaces you want to share, and specify the principals (accounts, OUs, or the organization) that should have access. This enables platform engineers to use the same namespace to register Amazon ECS Service Connect services residing in multiple AWS accounts, simplifying service discovery and connectivity. Application developers can then build services that rely on a consistent, shared registry without worrying about availability or synchronization across accounts. Cross-account connectivity support improves operational efficiency and makes it easier to scale Amazon ECS workloads as your organization grows by reducing duplication and streamlining access to common services.\n  This feature is available with both Fargate and EC2 launch modes in AWS GovCloud (US-West) and AWS GovCloud (US-East) regions via the AWS Management Console, API, SDK, CLI, and CloudFormation.

When an account is moved to a new OU, AWS Control Tower automatically enrolls the account, applying the baseline configurations and controls from the new OU and removing those from the original OU. With this feature, customers can further simplify their new account provisioning workflows by creating an account and then moving it into the right OU using the AWS Organizations console or the CreateAccount and MoveAccount APIs.\n  Customers on landing zone version 3.1 and higher can opt in to this feature by toggling the automatically enroll accounts flag in their Landing Zone settings or using the Create or UpdateLandingZone APIs by setting the value of the RemediationTypes parameter to Inheritance_Drift. To learn more about this functionality, review Move and enroll accounts with auto-enrollment. For a list of AWS Regions where AWS Control Tower is available, see the AWS Region Table.",

This helps customers enforce tagging standards that conform to Service Control Policies (SCP) and helps enable cost tracking reporting practices on resources created across the organization.\n  As an Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio administrator, you can configure a project profile with tag configurations that will be pushed down to all projects using the project profile. Project profiles can be setup to pass Key and Value tag pairings or pass the Key of the tag with a default Value that can be modified during project creation. All tag values passed to the project will result in the resources created by that project being tagged. This provides administrators a governance mechanism that enforces project resources have the expected tags.\n  This first release of custom tags for project resources is supported only through application programming interface (API).\n  Custom tags for project resources capability is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio is supported, including: Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Ireland), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), South America (São Paulo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Europe (London), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm)\n  To learn more, visit Amazon SageMaker then get started with the custom tag API documentation.",
