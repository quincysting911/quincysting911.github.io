      "description": "Amazon Connect Contact Lens now provides sensitive data redaction from voice and chat conversational analytics in French (France, Canada), Portuguese (Portugal, Brazil), Italian, German, and Spanish (Spain). Automatic redaction of sensitive data redaction helps you protect your customer's privacy by removing personally identifiable information (PII), financial account numbers and PINs, and Internet access details (URLs, usernames, passwords) from conversation transcripts and audio files. You can choose to redact selected or all sensitive data entities, and whether they are replaced with a generic placeholder (e.g., [PII]) or an entity-specific placeholder (e.g., [NAME]) to indicate the type of information redacted.\n  Amazon Connect is an AI-powered application that provides one seamless experience for your contact center customers and users. Contact Lens provides conversational analytics that enable you to monitor, measure, and continuously improve contact quality and agent performance for a better overall customer experience.\n  Sensitive data redaction is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Connect is available. For more information, refer to the following list of resources:\n  \n \n \nAmazon Connect Contact Lens and pricing\n \n \nEnable redaction of sensitive information\n \n \nSupported languages",

      "description": "AWS Organizations now offers full IAM policy language support for service control policies (SCPs), enabling you to write SCPs with the same flexibility as IAM managed policies. With this launch, SCPs now support use of conditions, individual resource ARNs, and the NotAction element with Allow statements. Additionally, you can now use wildcards at the beginning or middle of Action element strings and the NotResource element.\n  With these policy language enhancements, you can now create more concise and precise policies to implement sophisticated permissions guardrails across your organization. For example, you can restrict access to specific resources with condition statements. The enhanced functionality maintains backward compatibility with existing SCPs, so no changes to current policies are required.\n  This feature is now available in all AWS commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.\n  To learn more about the enhanced SCP capabilities, see service control policies in the AWS Organizations User Guide and AWS blog.",

      "description": "Amazon Kinesis Data Streams now allows customers to make API requests over Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Customers have the option of using either IPv6 or IPv4 when sending requests over dual-stack public or VPC endpoints. The new endpoints have also been validated under the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-3 program.\n  Kinesis Data Streams allows users to capture, process, and store data streams in real time at any scale. IPv6 increases the number of available addresses by several orders of magnitude, so customers will no longer need to manage overlapping address spaces. Many devices and networks today already use IPv6, and now they can easily write to and read from data streams. FIPS-compliant endpoints help companies contracting with the US federal governments meet the FIPS security requirement to encrypt sensitive data in supported Regions.\n  Support for IPv6 with Kinesis Data Streams is now available in all Regions where Kinesis Data Streams is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) and China Regions. See here for a full listing of our Regions. To learn more about Kinesis Data Streams, please refer to our Developer Guide.",
