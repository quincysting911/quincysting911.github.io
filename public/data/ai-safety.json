Quick is Amazon's new AI-powered workspace and agentic teammate that helps organizations get answers from their business data and move quickly from insights to action. As organizations navigate newly adopted AI agents and work with existing enterprise tools for CRM, support, collaboration, and more, users face fragmented experiences. Users are forced to switch between different interfaces, repeat context, and manually stitch together outputs. Quick enables users to work with third-party agents and enterprise tools from a single interface, eliminating the wasted time and cognitive load of constantly switching between applications.\n  With Quick, business users can now invoke specialized agents from Box, Canva, and PagerDuty to accomplish chat and automation tasks. For example, you can pull incident insights from PagerDuty, generate a presentation in Canva, and query documents stored in Box - all directly from Quick. Additionally, Quick has expanded its built-in actions to include integrations with GitHub, Notion, Canva, Box, Linear, Hugging Face, Monday.com, HubSpot, Intercom, and more. This enables Quick users to accomplish tasks like creating GitHub issues, summarizing meeting notes in Notion, managing their CRM, and more.

      "description": "Today, AWS announces a simplified onboarding experience for AWS Client VPN, introducing a new Quickstart setup method that streamlines the process of creating and configuring Client VPN endpoints.\n  AWS Client VPN allows you to securely connect remote users to AWS resources and on-premises networks. The new Quickstart setup, reduces the number of steps required to set up an Client VPN endpoint. You can now easily set up Client VPN endpoints with pre-defined default configurations, requiring only three key inputs: IPv4 CIDR, server certificate ARN, and subnet selection. For example, development teams in large organizations who use Client VPN for remote access to their VPC resources for quick testing can now create endpoints quickly with the new simplified setup process.\n  The Quickstart method is available alongside the existing Standard Setup option, giving you the flexibility to choose the approach that best fits your deployment needs. Additionally, when you create a VPC, the Client VPN Quickstart workflow is automatically suggested as a follow up step. Once endpoint creation is complete, you can immediately download the client configuration file to connect using your VPN client. You can later modify and enhance your endpoint configuration using the Client VPN standard console or API as your usage patterns evolve. This enhancement is available at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where AWS Client VPN is generally available.\n  To learn more about Client VPN:\n  \n \n \nVisit the AWS Client VPN product page\n \n \nRead the AWS Client VPN documentation",

With tmpfs, you can now create memory‑backed file systems for your containerized workloads without writing this data to task storage.\n  tmpfs mounts provide a temporary file system that is backed by memory and exposed inside the container at a path you choose. This is ideal for performance‑sensitive workloads that need fast access to scratch files, caches, or temporary working sets, and for security‑sensitive data such as short‑lived secrets or credentials, because the data does not persist after the task stops. tmpfs also lets you keep the container root file system read‑only using the readonlyRootFilesystem setting while still allowing applications to write to specific in‑memory directories.\n  To get started, update your task definition so that the container definitions include a linuxParameters block with one or more tmpfs entries. For each tmpfs mount, specify the containerPath, size, and optional mountOptions. You can register or update task definitions using the Amazon ECS console, AWS CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS CDK.

To maintain security, all collaboration members must approve change requests before updates take affect, ensuring that existing privacy controls remain protected. For transparency, all change requests are logged in the change history for member review. For example, when a publisher creates a Clean Rooms collaboration with an advertiser, the publisher can add the advertiser’s marketing agency as a new member that can receive the analysis results directly in their account, enabling faster time-to-insights and streamlined campaign optimizations with the publisher. This approach reduces onboarding time while maintaining the existing privacy controls for you and your partners.\n  With AWS Clean Rooms, customers can create a secure data clean room in minutes and collaborate with any company on AWS or Snowflake to generate unique insights about advertising campaigns, investment decisions, and research and development. For more information about the AWS Regions where AWS Clean Rooms is available, see the AWS Regions table. To learn more about collaborating with AWS Clean Rooms, visit AWS Clean Rooms.",

These capabilities help procurement, software asset management, and cloud governance teams enforce compliance policies while maintaining purchasing agility.\n  Administrators can now enforce their mandatory purchase order policy by requiring buyers to provide purchase orders when subscribing to products through AWS Marketplace. These requirements can be applied to purchases through a private and public offer across various pricing types. Additionally, administrators can add a custom message on the procurement page, providing guidance on policy requirements and support contacts. Organizations can implement purchase order requirements without custom messaging, use custom messaging to guide buyers through the procurement process, or combine both features for more comprehensive governance. These capabilities can also be used with Private Marketplace, which allows customers to create a curated catalog of approved products for specific users and groups within an AWS organization. This flexibility helps finance and procurement teams enforce compliance at the time of purchase, improve cost allocation accuracy, and streamline procurement-to-pay cycles.\n  These capabilities are available today in all AWS Regions where AWS Marketplace is supported.\n  For information on configuring purchase order requirements and custom messaging, refer to the AWS Marketplace Buyer Guide.",
