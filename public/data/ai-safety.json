      "title": "Announcing the Apache Spark upgrade agent for Amazon EMR",
      "description": "AWS announces the Apache Spark upgrade agent, a new capability that accelerates Apache Spark version upgrades for Amazon EMR on EC2 and EMR Serverless. The agent converts complex upgrade processes that typically take months into projects spanning weeks through automated code analysis and transformation. Organizations invest substantial engineering resources analyzing API changes, resolving conflicts, and validating applications during Spark upgrades. The agent introduces conversational interfaces where engineers express upgrade requirements in natural language, while maintaining full control over code modifications.\n  The Apache Spark upgrade agent automatically identifies API changes and behavioral modifications across PySpark and Scala applications. Engineers can initiate upgrades directly from SageMaker Unified Studio, Kiro CLI or IDE of their choice with the help of MCP (Model Context Protocol) compatibility. During the upgrade process, the agent analyzes existing code and suggests specific changes, and engineers can review and approve before implementation. The agent validates functional correctness through data quality validations. The agent currently supports upgrades from Spark 2.4 to 3.5 and maintains data processing accuracy throughout the upgrade process.\n  The Apache Spark upgrade agent is now available in all AWS Regions where SageMaker Unified Studio is available. To start using the agent, visit SageMaker Unified Studio and select IDE Spaces or install the Kiro CLI. For detailed implementation guidance, reference documentation, and migration examples, visit the documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon S3 Storage Lens provides organization-wide visibility into your storage usage and activity to help optimize costs, improve performance, and strengthen data protection. Today, we are adding three new capabilities to S3 Storage Lens that give you deeper insights into your S3 storage usage and application performance: performance metrics that provide insights into how your applications interact with S3 data, analytics for billions of prefixes in your buckets, and metrics export directly to S3 Tables for easier querying and analysis.\n  We are adding three specific types of performance metrics. Access pattern metrics identify inefficient requests, including those that are too small and create unnecessary network overhead. Request origin metrics, such as cross-Region request counts, show when applications access data across regions, impacting latency and costs. Object access count metrics reveal when applications frequently read a small subset of objects that could be optimized through caching or moving to high-performance storage.\n  We are expanding the prefix analytics in S3 Storage Lens to enable analyzing billions of prefixes per bucket, whereas previously metrics were limited to the largest prefixes that met minimum size and depth thresholds. This gives you visibility into storage usage and activity across all your prefixes. Finally, we are making it possible to export metrics directly to managed S3 Tables, making them immediately available for querying with AWS analytics services like Amazon QuickSight and enabling you to join this data with other AWS service data for deeper insights.\n  To get started, enable performance metrics or expanded prefixes in your S3 Storage Lens advanced metrics dashboard configuration. These capabilities are available in all AWS Regions, except for AWS China Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. You can enable metrics export to managed S3 Tables in both free and advanced dashboard configurations in AWS Regions where S3 Tables are available. To learn more, visit the S3 Storage Lens overview page, documentation, S3 pricing page, and read the AWS News Blog.",

      "description": "Amazon S3 Vectors, the first cloud object storage with native support to store and query vectors, is now generally available. S3 Vectors delivers purpose-built, cost-optimized vector storage for AI agents, inference, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and semantic search at billion-vector scale. S3 Vectors is designed to provide the same elasticity, durability, and availability as Amazon S3 and reduces the total costs to upload, store, and query vectors by up to 90%. With general availability, you can store and query up to two billion vectors per index and elastically scale to 10,000 vector indexes per vector bucket. Infrequent queries continue to return results in under one second, with more frequent queries now resulting in latencies around 100 milliseconds or less. Your application can achieve write throughput of 1,000 vectors per second when streaming single-vector updates into your indexes, retrieve up to 100 search results per query, and store up to 50 metadata keys alongside each vector for fine-grained filtering in your queries.\n \nWith S3 Vectors you get a new bucket type—a vector bucket—that is optimized for durable, low-cost vector storage. Within vector buckets, you organize your vector data with vector indexes and get a dedicated set of APIs to store, access, and query vectors without provisioning any infrastructure. By default, S3 Vectors encrypts all vector data in a vector bucket with server-side encryption using S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or optionally, you can use AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) to set a default customer-managed key to encrypt all new vector indexes in the vector bucket. You can now also set a dedicated customer-managed key per vector index, helping you build scalable multi-tenant applications and meet regulatory and governance requirements. You can also tag vector buckets and indexes for attribute-based access control (ABAC) as well as to track and organize costs using AWS Billing and Cost Management.\n \nS3 Vectors integrates with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to reduce the cost of using large vector datasets for RAG. When creating a Knowledge Base in Amazon Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio, you can choose an existing Amazon S3 vector index or create a new one using the Quick Create workflow. With Amazon OpenSearch Service, you can optimize costs for hybrid search workloads by configuring OpenSearch to automatically manage vector storage in S3.\n \nS3 Vectors is now generally available in 14 AWS Regions, expanding from 5 Regions in preview.

      "description": "AWS announces important configuration updates coming July 31st, 2025, affecting AWS SDKs and CLIs default settings. Two key changes include switching the AWS Security Token Service (STS) endpoint to regional and updating the default retry strategy to standard. These updates aim to improve service availability and reliability by implementing regional endpoints to reduce cross-regional dependencies and introducing token-bucket throttling for standardized retry behavior. Organizations should test their applications before the release date and can opt-in early or temporarily opt-out of these changes. These updates align with AWS best practices for optimal service performance and security.",
