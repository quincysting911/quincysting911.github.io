      "description": "Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now supports Managed Tiered KV Cache and Intelligent Routing for large language model (LLM) inference, enabling customers to optimize inference performance for long-context prompts and multi-turn conversations. Customers deploying production LLM applications need fast response times while processing lengthy documents or maintaining conversation context, but traditional inference approaches require recalculating attention mechanisms for all previous tokens with each new token generation, creating computational overhead and escalating costs. Managed Tiered KV Cache addresses this challenge by intelligently caching and reusing computed values, while Intelligent Routing directs requests to optimal instances.\n  These capabilities deliver up to 40% latency reduction, 25% throughput improvement, and 25% cost savings compared to baseline configurations. The Managed Tiered KV Cache feature uses a two-tier architecture combining local CPU memory (L1) with disaggregated cluster-wide storage (L2). AWS-native disaggregated tiered storage is the recommended backend, providing scalable terabyte-scale capacity and automatic tiering from CPU memory to local SSD for optimal memory and storage utilization. We also offer Redis as an alternative L2 cache option. The architecture enables efficient reuse of previously computed key-value pairs across requests. The newly introduced Intelligent Routing maximizes cache utilization through three configurable strategies: prefix-aware routing for common prompt patterns, KV-aware routing for maximum cache efficiency with real-time cache tracking, and round-robin for stateless workloads. These features work seamlessly together. Intelligent routing directs requests to instances with relevant cached data, reducing time to first token in document analysis and maintaining natural conversation flow in multi-turn dialogues. Built-in observability integration with Amazon Managed Grafana provides metrics for monitoring performance. You can enable these features through InferenceEndpointConfig or SageMaker JumpStart when deploying models via the HyperPod Inference Operator on EKS-orchestrated clusters.\n  These features are available in all regions where SageMaker HyperPod is available.

Customers can now ensure only clients presenting trusted certificates can access their distributions, helping protect against unauthorized access and security threats.\n  Previously, customers had to spend ongoing effort implementing and maintaining their own client access management solutions, leading to undifferentiated heavy lifting. Now with the support for mutual TLS, customers can easily validate client identities at the AWS edge before connections are established with their application servers or APIs. Example use cases include B2B secure API integrations for enterprises and client authentication for IoT. For B2B API security, enterprises can authenticate API requests from trusted third parties and partners using mutual TLS. For IoT use cases, enterprises can validate that devices are authorized to receive proprietary content such as firmware updates. Customers can leverage their existing third-party Certificate Authorities or AWS Private Certificate Authority to sign the X.509 certificates. With Mutual TLS, customers get the performance and scale benefits of CloudFront for workloads that require client authentication.\n  Mutual TLS authentication is available to all CloudFront customers at no additional cost.

You can connect your Agentic Chat to your data through connectors to search SharePoint, websites, send Slack messages, or create Jira tasks and customize the Agent with your brand colors, communication style, and personalized greetings. Security always stays under your control as you choose what the agent accesses and explicitly scope all actions.\n  Quick Suite Embedded Chat is available the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Europe (Ireland), and we'll expand availability to additional AWS Regions over the coming months. There is no additional cost for Quick Suite Embedded Chat. Existing Quick Suite pricing is available here.\n  To learn more, see Embedding Amazon Quick Suite launch blog.

      "description": "AWS Lambda launches enhanced error handling capabilities for Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) and self-managed Apache Kafka (SMK) event sources. These capabilities allow customers to build custom retry configurations, optimize retries of failed messages, and send failed events to a Kafka topic as an on-failure destination, enabling customers to build resilient Kafka workloads with robust error handling strategies.\n  Customers use Kafka event source mappings (ESM) with their Lambda functions to build their mission-critical Kafka applications. Kafka ESM offers robust error handling of failed events by retrying events with exponential backoff, and retaining failed events in on-failure destinations like Amazon SQS, Amazon S3, Amazon SNS. However, customers need customized error handling to meet stringent business and performance requirements. With this launch, developers can now exercise precise control over failed event processing and leverage Kafka topics as an additional on-failure destination when using Provisioned mode for Kafka ESM. Customers can now define specific retry limits and time boundaries for retry, automatically discarding failed records beyond these limits to customer-specified destination. They can now also set automatic retries of failed records in the batch and enhance their function code to report individual failed messages, optimizing the retry process.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Commercial Regions where AWS Lambda’s Provisioned mode for Kafka ESM is available.\n  To enable these capabilities, provide configuration parameters for your Kafka ESM in the ESM API, AWS Console, and AWS CLI. To learn more, read the Lambda ESM documentation and AWS Lambda pricing.",

The solution supports running multiple IDEs on the same GPU-instance, as well as on a single-GPU, by leveraging Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) support on HyperPod.\n  Administrators can maximize CPU/GPU investments through unified governance across IDEs, training, and inference workloads using HyperPod Task Governance. HyperPod Observability provides comprehensive usage metrics including CPU, GPU, and memory consumption, enabling administrators to optimize cluster utilization and manage costs effectively.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is currently available, excluding China and GovCloud (US) regions.

      "description": "Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) now supports synchronous API processing for images, enabling you to receive structured insights from visual content with low latency. Synchronous processing for images complements the existing asynchronous API, giving you the flexibility to choose the right approach based on your application's latency requirements.\n  BDA automates the generation of insights from unstructured multimodal content such as documents, images, audio, and videos for your GenAI-powered applications. With synchronous image processing, you can build interactive experiences—such as social media platforms that moderate user-uploaded photos, e-commerce apps that identify products from customer images, or travel applications that recognize landmarks and provide contextual information. This eliminates polling or callback handling, simplifying your application architecture and reducing development complexity. Synchronous processing supports both Standard Output for common image analysis tasks like summarization and text extraction, and Custom Output using Blueprints for industry-specific field extraction. You now get the high-quality, structured results you expect from BDA with low-latency response times that enable more responsive user experiences.\n  Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is available in 8 AWS regions: Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (London), Europe (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Sydney), US West (Oregon) and US East (N. Virginia), and AWS GovCloud (US-West) AWS Regions.\n  To learn more, see the Bedrock Data Automation User Guide and the Amazon Bedrock Pricing page.
