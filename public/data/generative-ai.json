This feature reduces session setup time from minutes to tens of seconds for enterprise customers processing hundreds or thousands of automated browser sessions daily.\n \nBrowser profiles persist and reuse browser data including cookies and local storage across multiple sessions. You authenticate to a website once and save the session to a browser profile. When you start a new session using that saved profile, your authentication state is preserved, and you remain logged in. This enables agents to perform tasks on authenticated websites without manual login intervention. You can choose flexible session modes for both read-only and persistent operations, enabling parallel processing where multiple sessions use the same profile simultaneously.\n \nThis feature is available in all 14 AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser is available: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Canada (Central).\n \nTo learn more, visit the Browser Profiles documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon RDS for Oracle now supports cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes. With additional storage volumes, customers can add up to three storage volumes, each with up to 64 TiB, in addition to the primary storage volume for their database instance. As a result, customers get flexibility to add or remove storage with evolving workload demands, without incurring application downtime, and set up their database instance with up to 256 TiB storage. Now, with support for cross-Region replicas, customers that set up database instances with cross-Region replicas for business-critical applications also get the benefit of using additional storage volumes for storage flexibility.\n  When you create a cross-Region replica for a database instance that is set up with additional storage volumes, Amazon RDS for Oracle automatically configures the same storage layout on the replica. Subsequently, you can apply changes to additional storage volumes on the primary instance and the replica using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a cross-Region replica to serve as the new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica to meet low recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for business critical applications.\n  You will need an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license to use replicas in mounted mode, and an additional Oracle Active Data Guard license to use replicas in read-only mode. We recommend consulting your legal team or licensing expert to verify Oracle license requirements for your specific use case. Amazon RDS for Oracle cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes is available in all AWS Regions including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

With these automated procedures, customers can deploy web applications to their AWS account using natural language prompts from any MCP-compatible IDE or CLI, including Kiro, Kiro CLI, Cursor, and Claude Code. Deployment works by generating AWS CDK infrastructure, deploying CloudFormation stacks, and creating CI/CD pipelines with recommended AWS security best practices.\n  Previously, developers struggled to take their vibe-coded applications to production with DevOps best practices in place. Now, developers can move quickly from prototype to production in as little as one prompt. When you ask your AI assistant configured with AWS MCP Server to deploy your web application, your AI agent will follow the multi-step plan defined in Agent SOPs to analyze the project structure, generate CDK infrastructure, and deploy a preview environment hosted on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. Once you are ready, it can configure AWS CodePipeline for automated production deployments from source repositories, setting up CI/CD automatically for your application. The Agent SOPs support web applications built with popular frameworks including React, Vue.js, Angular, and Next.js. Deployment documentation is automatically created in the repository, enabling agents to handle future deployments, query logs for troubleshooting and resume work across sessions.\n  The Agent SOPs are available in preview as part of the AWS MCP Server at no additional cost in the US East (N.

      "description": "Today, AWS announced support for response streaming in Amazon API Gateway to significantly improve the responsiveness of your REST APIs by progressively streaming response payloads back to the client. With this new capability, you can use streamed responses to enhance user experience when building LLM-driven applications (such as AI agents and chatbots), improve time-to-first-byte (TTFB) performance for web and mobile applications, stream large files, and perform long-running operations while reporting incremental progress using protocols such as server-sent events (SSE).",

      "description": "Generative AI agents in production environments demand resilience strategies that go beyond traditional software patterns. AI agents make autonomous decisions, consume substantial computational resources, and interact with external systems in unpredictable ways. These characteristics create failure modes that conventional resilience approaches might not address. This post presents a framework for AI agent resilience risk analysis […]",
