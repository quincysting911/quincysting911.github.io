This release streamlines centralized provisioning of threat detection workflows using Amazon GuardDuty S3 Protection, helping you meet data security requirements by identifying potential threats in transferred files.\n  AWS Transfer Family provides fully managed file transfers over SFTP, AS2, FTPS, FTP, and web browser-\n based interfaces for AWS storage services. Using the new module, you can programmatically provision workflows to scan incoming files, dynamically route files based on scan results, and generate threat notifications, in a single deployment. You can granularly implement threat detection for specific S3 prefixes while preserving folder structures post scanning, and ensure that only verified clean files reach your business applications and data lakes. This eliminates the overhead and risks associated with manual configurations, and provides a scalable deployment option for data security compliance.\n  Customers can get started by using the new module from the Terraform Registry.

      "description": "Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) now supports R8gd and M8gd database instances for Optimized Reads on Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL and RDS for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB. R8gd and M8gd database instances offer improved price-performance. For example, Optimized Reads on R8gd instances deliver up to 165% better throughput and up to 120% better price-performance over R6g instances for Aurora PostgreSQL.\n  Optimized Reads uses local NVMe-based SSD block storage available on these instances to store ephemeral data, such as temporary tables, reducing data access to/from network-based storage and improving read latency and throughput. The result is improved query performance for complex queries and faster index rebuild operations. Aurora PostgreSQL Optimized Reads instances using the I/O-Optimized configuration additionally use the local storage to extend their caching capacity. Database pages that are evicted from the in-memory buffer cache are cached in local storage to speed subsequent retrieval of that data.\n  Customers can get started with Optimized Reads through the AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDK by modifying their existing Aurora and RDS databases or creating a new database using R8gd or M8gd instances. These instances are available in the US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Spain, Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Regions. For complete information on pricing and regional availability, please refer to the pricing page. For information on specific engine versions that support these DB instance types, please see the Aurora and RDS documentation.",

The flat-rate plans, available with Amazon CloudFront, combine global content delivery with AWS WAF, DDoS protection, Amazon Route 53 DNS, Amazon CloudWatch Logs ingestion, and serverless edge compute into a simple monthly price with no overage charges. Each plan also includes monthly Amazon S3 storage credits to help offset your storage costs.\n  CloudFront flat-rate plans allow you to deliver your websites and applications without calculating costs across multiple AWS services. You won’t face the risk of overage charges, even if your website or application goes viral or faces a DDoS attack. Security features like WAF and DDoS protection are enabled by default, and additional configurations are simple to set up. When you serve your AWS applications through CloudFront instead of directly to the internet, your flat-rate plan covers the data transfer costs between your applications and your viewers for a simple monthly price without the worry of overages. This simplified pricing model is available alongside pay-as-you-go pricing for each CloudFront distribution, giving you the flexibility to choose the right pricing model and feature set for each application.\n  Plans are available in Free ($0/month), Pro ($15/month), Business ($200/month), and Premium ($1,000/month) tiers for new and existing CloudFront distributions. Select the plan tier with the features and usage allowances matching your application’s needs. To learn more, refer to the Launch Blog, Plans and Pricing, or CloudFront Developer Guide.

US West (Oregon) is the backup for all regions in commercial partition, while US East (N. Virginia) is the backup for US West (Oregon). Plus, this change also enables a simplified integration path, where customers can now setup a single rule in US West (Oregon) to capture all Health events from across commercial partition, as opposed to needing to configure rules in individual regions. Customers now have greater flexibility in their integration approach for receiving Health events.\n  This update is available in all AWS regions.

      "description": "Amazon EventBridge now supports Amazon SQS fair queues as targets, enabling you to build more responsive event-driven applications. You can now leverage SQSs improved message distribution across consumer groups and mitigate the noisy neighbor impact in multi-tenant messaging systems. This enhancement allows EventBridge to send events directly to SQS fair queues. With fair queues, multiple consumers can process messages from the same tenant at the same time, while keeping message processing times consistent across all tenants.\n  The Amazon EventBridge event bus is a serverless event broker that enables you to create scalable event-driven applications by routing events between your own applications, third-party SaaS applications, and other AWS services. SQS fair queues automatically distribute messages fairly across consumer groups, preventing any single group from monopolizing queue resources. When combined with EventBridge's event routing capabilities, this creates powerful patterns for building scalable, multi-tenant applications where different teams or services need equitable access to event streams.\n  To route events to an SQS fair queue, you can select the fair queue as a target when creating or updating EventBridge rules through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Be sure to include a MessageGroupID parameter, which can be specified with either a static value or JSON path expression.\n  Support for Fair Queue and FIFO targets is available in all AWS commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. For more information about EventBridge target support, see our documentation. For more information about SQS Fair Queues, see the SQS documentation.",

Today, we're extending support for existing MCP servers as a new target type in AgentCore Gateway. With this capability, you can group multiple task-specific MCP servers aligned to agent goals behind a single, manageable MCP gateway interface. This reduces the operational complexity of maintaining separate gateways, while providing the same centralized tool and authentication management that existed for REST APIs and AWS Lambda functions.",
