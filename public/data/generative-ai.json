You can view aggregated metrics for an entire business unit (forecast group) or broken down by specific demand segments (demand groups). You can then visualize this data in Amazon Quick Sight or another BI tool of your choice for further analysis, such as identifying periods of over or under-staffing. This eliminates the need for manual reviews of agent schedules thus improving productivity for schedulers and supervisors.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Connect agent scheduling is available.

Blueprint instruction optimization analyzes the differences between your expected results and the Data Automation inference results, and then refines the natural language instructions to improve extraction accuracy across your examples. For your intelligent document processing applications, you can now improve the accuracy of extracting insights such as invoice line items, contract terms, tax form fields, or medical billing codes. After optimization completes, you receive detailed evaluation metrics including exact match rates and F1 scores measured against your ground truth, giving you confidence that your blueprint is ready for production deployment. \n  Data Automation blueprint instruction optimization for documents is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is supported. \n  To learn more, see the Bedrock Data Automation User Guide and the Amazon Bedrock Pricing page. To get started with blueprint instruction optimization, navigate to your blueprint in the Amazon Bedrock console, go to Data Automation, select your custom outputs for documents, and select Start Optimization.",
