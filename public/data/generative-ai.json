This new capability helps distinguish trusted bot traffic from potentially harmful automated access attempts.\n \nWeb Bot Auth is an authentication method that leverages cryptographic signatures in HTTP messages to verifythat a request comes from an automated bot. Web Bot Auth is used as a verification method for verified bots and signed agents. It relies on two active IETF drafts: a directory draft allowing the crawler to share their public keys, and a protocol draft defining how these keys should be used to attach crawler's identity to HTTP requests.\n \nAWS WAF now automatically allows verified AI agent traffic Verified WBA bots will now be automatically allowed by default, previously Category AI blocked unverified bots, this behavior is now refined to respect WBA verification.\n \nTo learn more, please review the documentation.",

This helps you reduce the time required to investigate and respond to potential security events, thereby minimizing business disruption.\n  When a security event case is created in the Security Incident Response console, the investigative agent immediately assesses the case details to identify missing information, such as potential indicators, resource names, and timeframes. It asks the case submitter clarifying questions to gather these details. This proactive approach helps minimize delays from back-and-forth communications that traditionally extend case resolution times. The investigative agent then collects relevant information from various data sources, such as AWS CloudTrail, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Amazon EC2, and AWS Cost Explorer. It automatically correlates this data to provide you with a comprehensive analysis, reducing the need for manual evidence gathering and enabling faster investigation. Security teams can track all investigation activities directly through the AWS console and view summaries in their preferred integration tools.\n  This feature is automatically enabled for all Security Incident Response customers at no additional cost in all AWS Regions where the service is available.\n  To learn more and get started, visit the Security Incident Response overview page and console.",

      "description": "AWS announces the general availability of a new GitHub Action and improvements to CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server that bring application observability into developer tools, making troubleshooting issues faster and more convenient. Previously, developers had to leave GitHub to triage production issues, look up trace data, and ensure observability coverage, often switching between consoles, dashboards, and source code. Starting today, Application observability for AWS GitHub Action helps you catch breaching SLOs or critical service errors, in GitHub workflows. In addition, now you can use the CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server in AI coding agents such as Kiro to identify the exact file, function, and line of code responsible for latency, errors, or SLO violations. Furthermore, you can get instrumentation guidance that ensures comprehensive observability coverage.\n  With this new GitHub Action, developers can mention @awsapm in GitHub Issues with prompts like \"Why is my checkout service experiencing high latency?\" and receive intelligent, observability-based responses without switching between consoles, saving time and effort. In addition, with improvements in CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server, developers can now ask questions like \"Which line of code caused the latency spike in my service?\". Furthermore, when instrumentation is missing, the MCP server can modify infrastructure-as-code (e.g., CDK, Terraform) to help teams set up OTel-based application performance monitoring for ECS, EKS, Lambda, and EC2 without requiring coding effort.\n  Together, these features bring observability into development workflows, reduce context switching, and power intelligent, agent-assisted debugging from code to production. To get started, visit Application Observability for AWS GitHub Action documentation and the CloudWatch Application Signals MCP server documentation.",

RabbitMQ 4.2 also includes various bug fixes and performance improvements for throughput and memory management.\n  A key highlight of RabbitMQ 4.2 is the support of AMQP 1.0 as a core protocol offering enhanced features like modified outcome which allow consumers to modify message annotations before requeueing or dead lettering, and granular flow control, which offers benefits including letting a client application dynamically adjust how many messages it wants to receive from a specific queue. Amazon MQ has also introduced configurable resource limits for RabbitMQ 4.2 brokers which you can modify based on your application requirements. Starting from RabbitMQ 4.0, mirroring of classic queues is no longer supported. Non-replicated classic queues are still supported. Quorum queues are the only replicated and durable queue type supported on RabbitMQ 4.2 brokers, and now offer message priorities in addition to consumer priorities.\n  To start using RabbitMQ 4.2 on Amazon MQ, simply select RabbitMQ 4.2 when creating a new broker using the m7g instance type through the AWS Management console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Amazon MQ automatically manages patch version upgrades for your RabbitMQ 4.2 brokers, so you need to only specify the major.minor version.

Amazon Redshift Serverless measures data warehouse capacity in RPUs. 1 RPU provides you 16 GB of memory. You pay only for the duration of workloads you run in RPU-hours on a per-second basis. Previously, the minimum base capacity required to run Amazon Redshift Serverless was 8 RPUs. You can start using Amazon Redshift Serverless for as low as $1.50 per hour and pay only for the compute capacity your data warehouse consumes when it is active.\n  Amazon Redshift Serverless enables users to run and scale analytics without managing data warehouse clusters. The new lower capacity configuration makes Amazon Redshift Serverless suitable for both production and development environments, particularly when workloads require minimal compute and memory resources. This entry-level configuration supports data warehouses with up to 32 TB of Redshift managed storage, offering a maximum of 100 columns per table and 64 GB of memory.\n  To get started, see the Amazon Redshift Serverless feature page, user documentation, and API Reference.",

Application map now detects and visualizes services not instrumented with Application Signals, providing out-of-the-box observability coverage in your distributed environment. In addition, it provides a single, unified view for applications, services, and infrastructure distributed across AWS accounts, enabling end-to-end visibility. Furthermore, it provides a history of recent changes, helping teams quickly correlate when a modification occurred and how it aligns with shifts in application health or performance.\n  These enhancements help SRE and DevOps teams troubleshoot issues faster and operate with greater confidence in large-scale, distributed environments. For example, when latency or error rates spike, developers can now investigate recent configuration changes, and analyze dependencies across multiple AWS accounts, all from a single map. During post-incident reviews, teams can use historical change data to understand what shifted and when, improving long-term reliability. By unifying service discovery, dependency mapping, and change history, application map reduces mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) and helps teams maintain application health across complex systems.\n  Starting today, the new capabilities in Application Map are available at no additional cost in all AWS commercial regions (except Taipei and New Zealand).

      "description": "AWS Site-to-Site VPN is collaborating with eero to simplify how customers connect their remote sites to AWS. This collaboration will help customers to establish secure connectivity between their remote sites and AWS in just a few clicks.\n  Many AWS customers operate hundreds of remote sites - from restaurants and retail stores to gas stations and mobile offices. These sites rely on WiFi to connect employees, customers, and IoT applications like kiosks, ATMs, and vending machines, while also connecting with AWS for business operations. These customers also need a faster and efficient way to connect hundreds of sites to AWS. For example, quick service restaurants need to connect their point of sales systems at each site to their payment gateways in AWS. AWS Site-to-Site VPN and eero are collaborating to simplify remote site connectivity by combining eero's ease of use with AWS's networking services. This solution leverages eero’s WiFi access points and network gateways to provide local connectivity. Using eero’s gateway appliances and AWS Site-to-Site VPN, customers can automatically establish VPN connectivity to access their applications hosted in AWS such as payment gateways for point of sales systems in just a few clicks. This makes it simple and faster for customers to scale their remote site connectivity across hundreds of sites and eliminates the need for an onsite technician with networking expertise to set-up the connectivity.\n  Customers can use eero devices in the US geography to establish connectivity to AWS using Site-to-Site VPN. To learn more and get started, visit the AWS Site-to-Site VPN documentation and eero documentation.",
