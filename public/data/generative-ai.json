      "description": "Amazon OpenSearch Service now offers a new multi-tier storage option powered by OpenSearch Optimized Instances. This new architecture combines Amazon S3 cloud technology with local instance storage to deliver improved durability and performance. The new multi-tier architecture features two tiers: hot and warm. The hot tier handles frequently accessed data, while the warm tier leverages Amazon S3 for cost-effective storage of less frequently accessed data. \n  Until now, Amazon OpenSearch Service supported a warm tier through UltraWarm, which provided cost-effective storage for read-only data. The new warm tier powered by OpenSearch Optimized instances supports write operations, providing greater flexibility for data management. You can automate rotating data from hot to warm as it ages using Index State Management feature.\n \nFor warm tier deployments, customers can use OpenSearch Optimized (OI2) instances (size ‘large’ to ‘8xlarge’), with addressable warm of up to five times the local cache size. tandard Managed Storage charges apply for warm data. The new Multi-tier experience is available on OpenSearch 3.3 and above. For more information please refer to the documentation.\n  New Multi-Tier experience on OI2 instance family is now available on Amazon OpenSearch Service across 12 regions globally: US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Spain).  Please refer to the Amazon OpenSearch Service pricing page for pricing details",

With this feature, Quick Suite remembers the preferences users specify in chat and generate responses that are tailored to them.

They also had to clarify ambiguous topics and entities in chat, increasing the tedious back and forth needed to get accurate and insightful responses. Memory addresses this pain point by remembering facts and details about users in a way that ensures responses provided to users continuously learn and improve. Users also control what Quick Suite remembers about them – all the memories are viewable and removable by users, and users have the choice to start chat in Private Mode in which conversations are not used to infer memories.\n  Memory in Quick Suite chat agents is available in US East (N.
