      "description": "Today, AWS announced enhanced map styling features for Amazon Location Service, enabling users to further customize maps with terrain visualization, contour lines, real-time traffic data, and transportation-specific routing information. Developers can create more detailed and informative maps tailored for various use cases, such as outdoor navigation, logistics planning, and traffic management, by leveraging parameters like terrain, contour-density, traffic, and travel-mode through the GetStyleDescriptor API.\n  With these styling capabilities, users can overlay real-time traffic conditions, visualize transportation-specific routing information such as transit and trucks, and display topographic features through elevation shading. For instance, developers can display current traffic conditions for optimized route planning, show truck-specific routing restrictions for logistics applications, or create maps that highlight physical terrain details for hiking and outdoor activities. Each feature operates seamlessly, providing enhanced map visualization and reliable performance for diverse use cases.\n  These new map styling features are available in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Spain), and South America (São Paulo).

Amazon Q Developer is the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for software development. With this launch, customers can now use Amazon Q Developer to get information about AWS product and service pricing, availability, and attributes, helping them select the right resources and estimate workload costs using natural language.\n  When architecting new workloads on AWS, customers need to estimate costs so they can evaluate cost/performance tradeoffs, set budgets, and plan future spending. Customers can now use Amazon Q Developer to retrieve detailed product attribute and pricing information using natural language, making it easier to estimate the cost of new workloads without having to review multiple pricing pages or specify detailed API request parameters. Customers can now ask questions about service pricing (e.g., “How much does RDS extended support cost?”), the cost of a planned workload (e.g., “I need to send 1 million notifications per month to email, and 1 million to HTTP/S endpoints. Estimate the monthly cost using SNS.”), or the relative costs of different resources (e.g., “What is the cost difference between an Application Load Balancer and a Network Load Balancer?”). To answer these questions, Amazon Q Developer retrieves information from the AWS Price List APIs.\n  To learn more, see Managing your costs using generative AI with Amazon Q Developer.
