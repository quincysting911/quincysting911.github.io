      "title": "Amazon RDS for Oracle now supports cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes",
      "description": "Amazon RDS for Oracle now supports cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes. With additional storage volumes, customers can add up to three storage volumes, each with up to 64 TiB, in addition to the primary storage volume for their database instance. As a result, customers get flexibility to add or remove storage with evolving workload demands, without incurring application downtime, and set up their database instance with up to 256 TiB storage. Now, with support for cross-Region replicas, customers that set up database instances with cross-Region replicas for business-critical applications also get the benefit of using additional storage volumes for storage flexibility.\n  When you create a cross-Region replica for a database instance that is set up with additional storage volumes, Amazon RDS for Oracle automatically configures the same storage layout on the replica. Subsequently, you can apply changes to additional storage volumes on the primary instance and the replica using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDK. In disaster recovery situations, you can promote a cross-Region replica to serve as the new standalone database, or execute a switchover to reverse roles between the primary database and the replica to meet low recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) for business critical applications.\n  You will need an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition (EE) license to use replicas in mounted mode, and an additional Oracle Active Data Guard license to use replicas in read-only mode. We recommend consulting your legal team or licensing expert to verify Oracle license requirements for your specific use case. Amazon RDS for Oracle cross-Region replicas with additional storage volumes is available in all AWS Regions including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more, see Amazon RDS for Oracle User Guide.",

You can now modify responses from external SAML and OIDC providers before they are stored in your user pool, providing complete programmatic control over the federation flow without requiring changes to your identity provider configuration..\n \nInbound federation Lambda trigger addresses current limitations in federated authentication workflows, particularly issues caused by attribute size limits and the need for selective attribute storage from external identity providers. For example, large group attributes from external SAML or OIDC identity providers that exceed Cognito’s 2,048 character limit per attribute can block the authentication flow. This capability allows you to add, override, or suppress attribute values, such as modifying large group attributes, before creating new federated users or updating existing federated user profiles in Cognito.\n \nThe new inbound federation Lambda trigger is available through hosted UI (classic) and managed login in all AWS Regions where Amazon Cognito is available. To get started, configure the trigger using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), Cloud Development Kit (CDK), or AWS CloudFormation by adding the new parameter to your User Pool LambdaConfig.

This capability is available for tables in both provisioned and on-demand capacity modes, including multi-Region replicated tables.\n  Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra–compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces is serverless, so you pay for only the resources that you use and you can build applications that serve thousands of requests per second with virtually unlimited throughput and storage.\n  While Amazon Keyspaces automatically scales to accommodate growing workloads, certain scenarios like application launches, marketing campaigns, or seasonal events can create sudden traffic spikes that exceed normal scaling patterns. With pre-warming, you can now manually specify your expected peak throughput requirements during table creation or update operations, ensuring your tables are immediately ready to handle large traffic surges without scaling delays or increased error rates.\n  The pre-warming process is non-disruptive and runs asynchronously, allowing you to continue making other table modifications while pre-warming is in progress. Pre-warming incurs a one-time charge based on the difference between your specified values and the baseline capacity.

      "description": "AWS announces the launch of deployment Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) available in the AWS MCP Server. SOPs are structured, natural language instructions that guide AI agents through complex, multi-step tasks to ensure consistent, reliable, and efficient behavior. With these automated procedures, customers can deploy web applications to their AWS account using natural language prompts from any MCP-compatible IDE or CLI, including Kiro, Kiro CLI, Cursor, and Claude Code. Deployment works by generating AWS CDK infrastructure, deploying CloudFormation stacks, and creating CI/CD pipelines with recommended AWS security best practices.\n  Previously, developers struggled to take their vibe-coded applications to production with DevOps best practices in place. Now, developers can move quickly from prototype to production in as little as one prompt. When you ask your AI assistant configured with AWS MCP Server to deploy your web application, your AI agent will follow the multi-step plan defined in Agent SOPs to analyze the project structure, generate CDK infrastructure, and deploy a preview environment hosted on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. Once you are ready, it can configure AWS CodePipeline for automated production deployments from source repositories, setting up CI/CD automatically for your application. The Agent SOPs support web applications built with popular frameworks including React, Vue.js, Angular, and Next.js. Deployment documentation is automatically created in the repository, enabling agents to handle future deployments, query logs for troubleshooting and resume work across sessions.\n  The Agent SOPs are available in preview as part of the AWS MCP Server at no additional cost in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You pay only for AWS resources you create and applicable data transfer costs. To get started, see the AWS MCP Server documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) instances with locally attached NVMe storage can provide the performance needed for workloads demanding ultra-low latency and high I/O throughput. High-performance workloads, from high-frequency trading applications and in-memory databases to real-time analytics engines and AI/ML inference, need comprehensive performance tracking. Operating system tools like iostat and sar provide valuable system-level insights, and Amazon CloudWatch offers important disk IOPs and throughput measurements, but high-performance workloads can benefit from even more detailed visibility into instance store performance.",
