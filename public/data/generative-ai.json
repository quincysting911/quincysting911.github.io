This self-service capability helps customers efficiently manage their compliance documentation requirements, particularly during audits and vendor assessments that require historical compliance evidence.\n  To access previous report versions, you need the \"artifact:ListReportVersions\" IAM permission, which is included in the AWS managed policy \"AWSArtifactReportsReadOnlyAccess\". If you're unable to view previous versions of reports in the AWS Artifact console, please contact your AWS account administrator to request this permission.\n  Once authorized, you can access previous versions of compliance reports (such as SOC, ISO, and C5) directly through the AWS Artifact console. Simply navigate to the reports page and select any report to view its available versions. The availability of previous report versions varies by compliance program, with some reports offering versions from multiple prior years while others may have more limited historical coverage.\n  This feature is now generally available in US East (N.

With this feature, Quick Suite remembers the preferences users specify in chat and generate responses that are tailored to them. Users can also view their inferred preferences and remove any memory they don’t want Quick chat agents to use.\n  Previously, chat users needed to repeat their preferences around response format, acronyms, dashboards, and integrations in every conversation. They also had to clarify ambiguous topics and entities in chat, increasing the tedious back and forth needed to get accurate and insightful responses. Memory addresses this pain point by remembering facts and details about users in a way that ensures responses provided to users continuously learn and improve. Users also control what Quick Suite remembers about them – all the memories are viewable and removable by users, and users have the choice to start chat in Private Mode in which conversations are not used to infer memories.\n  Memory in Quick Suite chat agents is available in US East (N.

      "description": "Today, we’re announcing enhanced network policy capabilities in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), allowing customers to improve the network security posture for their Kubernetes workloads and their integrations with cluster-external destinations. This enhancement builds on network segmentation features previously supported in EKS. Now you can centrally enforce network access filters across the entire cluster, as well as leverage Domain Name System (DNS) based policies to secure egress traffic from your cluster’s environment.\n  As customers continue to scale their application environments using EKS, network traffic isolation is increasingly fundamental for preventing unauthorized access to resources inside and outside the cluster. To address this, EKS introduced support for Kubernetes NetworkPolicies in the Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (VPC CNI) plugin, allowing you to segment pod-to-pod communication at a namespace level. Now you can further strengthen the defensive posture for your Kubernetes network environment by centrally managing network filters for the whole cluster. Also, cluster admins now have a more stable and predictable approach for preventing unauthorized access to cluster-external resources in the cloud or on-prem using egress rules that filter traffic to external endpoints based on their Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).\n  These new network security features are available in all commercial AWS Regions for new EKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.29 or later, with support for existing clusters to follow in the coming weeks. ClusterNetworkPolicy is available in all EKS cluster launch modes using VPC CNI v1.21.0 or later. DNS-based policies are only supported in EKS Auto Mode-launched EC2 instances. To learn more, visit the Amazon EKS documentation or read the launch blog post here.",

Automatic semantic enrichment understands context and meaning, delivering more relevant results. For example, a search for \"eco-friendly transportation options\" finds matches about \"electric vehicles\" or \"public transportation\"—even when these exact terms aren't present. This new capability handles all semantic processing automatically, eliminating the need to manage machine learning models. It supports both English-only and multi-lingual variants, covering 15 languages including Arabic, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and more. You pay only for actual usage during data ingestion, billed as OpenSearch Compute Unit (OCU) - Semantic Search.

Now customers can ask Q questions about their SES resource setup and usage patterns, and Q will help them optimize their configuration and troubleshoot deliverability problems. This makes it easier to manage SES operational activities with less technical knowledge.\n  Previously, customers could use SES features such as Virtual Deliverability Manager to manage and explore their SES resource configuration and usage. SES provided convenient dashboard views and query tools to help customers find information, however customers needed deep understanding of email sending concepts to interact with the service. Now, customers can ask Q for help in optimizing resource configuration and troubleshooting deliverability challenges. Q will evaluate customer’s usage patterns and SES resource configuration, find the answers customers need, and help them understand the context without requiring pre-knowledge or manual exploration.\n  Q supports SES resource analysis in all AWS Regions where SES and Q are available.\n  For more information, see the Q documentation for information about interacting with SES through Q.",

      "description": "Amazon EMR Serverless now offers serverless storage that eliminates local storage provisioning for Apache Spark workloads, reducing data processing costs by up to 20% and preventing job failures from disk capacity constraints. You no longer need to configure local disk type and size for each application. EMR Serverless automatically handles intermediate data operation such as shuffle with no local storage charges. You pay only for compute and memory resources your job consumes.\n  EMR Serverless offloads intermediate data operations to a fully managed, auto-scaling serverless storage that encrypts data in transit and at rest with job-level isolation. Serverless storage decouples storage from compute, allowing Spark to release workers immediately when idle rather than keeping workers active to preserve temporary data. It eliminates job failures from insufficient disk capacity and reduces costs by avoiding idle worker charges. This is particularly valuable for jobs using dynamic resource allocation, such as recommendation engines processing millions of customer interactions, where initial stages process large datasets with high parallelism then narrow as data aggregates.\n  This feature is generally available for EMR release 7.12 and later. See Supported AWS Regions for availability. To get started, visit serverless storage for EMR Serverless documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon S3 Batch Operations now completes jobs up to 10x faster at a scale of up to 20 billion objects in a job, helping you accelerate large-scale storage operations.\n  With S3 Batch Operations, you can perform operations at scale such as copying objects between staging and production buckets, tagging objects for S3 Lifecycle management, or computing object checksums to verify the content of stored datasets. S3 Batch Operations now pre-processes objects, executes jobs, and generates completion reports up to 10x faster for jobs processing millions of objects with no additional configuration or cost. To get started, create a job in the AWS Management Console and specify operation type as well as filters like bucket, prefix, or creation date. S3 automatically generates the object list, creates an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with permission policies as needed, then initiates the job.\n  S3 Batch Operations performance improvements are available in all AWS Regions, except for AWS China Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. For pricing information, please visit the Management & Insights tab of the Amazon S3 pricing page. To learn more about S3 Batch Operations, visit the overview page and documentation.",

      "description": "AWS announces further enhancements to Amazon GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection with new capabilities to detect multistage attacks targeting Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) clusters running on AWS Fargate or Amazon EC2. GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms trained at AWS scale to automatically correlate security signals and detect critical threats. It analyzes multiple security signals across network activity, process runtime behavior, malware execution, and AWS API activity over extended periods to detect sophisticated attack patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n  With this launch, GuardDuty introduces two new critical-severity findings: AttackSequence:EC2/CompromisedInstanceGroup and AttackSequence:ECS/CompromisedCluster. These findings provide attack sequence information, allowing you to spend less time on initial analysis and more time responding to critical threats, minimizing business impact. For example, GuardDuty can identify suspicious processes followed by persistence attempts, crypto-mining activities, and reverse shell creation, representing these related events as a single, critical-severity finding. Each finding includes a detailed summary, events timeline, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques, and remediation recommendations.\n  While GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection is automatically enabled for GuardDuty customers at no additional cost, its detection comprehensiveness depends on your enabled GuardDuty protection plans. To improve attack sequence coverage and threat analysis of Amazon EC2 instances, enable Runtime Monitoring for EC2. To enable detection of compromised ECS clusters, enable Runtime Monitoring for Fargate or EC2 depending on your infrastructure type.\n  To get started, enable GuardDuty protection plans via the Console or API. New GuardDuty customers can start with a 30-day free trial, and existing customers who haven't used Runtime Monitoring can also try it free for 30 days. For additional information, visit the blog post and Amazon Guard Duty product page.",
