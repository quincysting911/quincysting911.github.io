These new capabilities help you better understand, monitor, and troubleshoot your Kubernetes network landscape in AWS.\n  Customers are increasingly deploying microservices to expand and incrementally innovate with software in the AWS cloud, while using Amazon EKS as the underlying platform to run their applications. With enhanced container network observability, customers can leverage granular, network-related metrics for better proactive anomaly detection across cluster traffic, cross-AZ flows, and AWS services. Using these metrics, customers can better measure system performance and visualize the underlying metrics using their preferred observability stack.\n  Additionally, EKS now provides network monitoring visualizations in the AWS console that accelerate and enhance precise troubleshooting for faster root cause analysis. Customers can also leverage these visual capabilities to pinpoint top-talkers and network flows causing retransmissions and retransmission timeouts, eliminating blind spots during incidents. These network monitoring features in EKS are powered by Amazon CloudWatch Network Flow Monitor.\n  Enhanced container network observability for EKS is available in all commercial AWS Regions where CloudWatch Network Flow Monitor is available.

The new archive storage class helps you meet your compliance and retention requirements while optimizing storage cost. As part of this launch, ECR lifecycle policies now support archiving images based on last pull time, allowing you to use lifecycle rules to automatically archive images based on usage patterns.\n  To get started, you can archive images by configuring lifecycle rules to automatically archive images based on criteria such as image age, count, or last pull time, or using the ECR Console or API to archive images individually. You can archive an unlimited number of images. Archived images do not count against your image per repository limit. Once the images are archived, they are no longer accessible for pulls, but can be easily restored via ECR Console, CLI, or API within 20 minutes. Once restored, images can be pulled normally. All archival and restore operations are logged through CloudTrail for auditability.\n  The new ECR archive storage class is available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.

This improves REST API responsiveness by eliminating the need to buffer complete responses before transmission. This new capability works with backends that support streaming, including Lambda functions, HTTP proxy integrations, and private integrations.\n  Response streaming delivers three key benefits: improved time-to-first-byte (TTFB) performance, extended integration timeouts up to 15 minutes, and support for payloads larger than 10 MB. Generative AI applications particularly benefit from improved TTFB as users see responses appear incrementally in real-time, while complex deliberation-focused models that take longer to process can now run with extended timeouts. Additionally, large payload support enables direct streaming of media files and large datasets without requiring workarounds like pre-signed Amazon S3 URLs.\n  To learn about pricing for this feature, please see the Amazon API Gateway pricing page. Amazon API Gateway response streaming is available in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions, and works with regional, private, and edge-optimized endpoints.

This new capability transforms how you build and manage complex live video workflows in the cloud, eliminating the need to reconfigure infrastructure as routing needs change. The router enables complex scenarios like switching between primary and backup feeds, routing regional variants independently, and managing multiple feeds for comprehensive coverage.\n  MediaConnect Router optimizes content delivery across the AWS network, reducing transport latency while improving packet delivery reliability when compared to standard transport technologies. This fully managed capability supports routing between inputs and outputs in any supported region as well as between private and public endpoints, and it eliminates operational overhead and unused capacity costs.\n  You can start using MediaConnect Router through the MediaConnect console, via MediaConnect API, or AWS CDK. It works independently or alongside existing MediaConnect flows. It can also be part of a larger video workflow with AWS Elemental, a family of media services that help customers process, monetize, and deliver the highest quality video at global scale.\n  MediaConnect Router is available in all standard AWS Regions.\n  To learn more about MediaConnect, please visit here.",

The result is improved query performance for complex queries and faster index rebuild operations. Aurora PostgreSQL Optimized Reads instances using the I/O-Optimized configuration additionally use the local storage to extend their caching capacity. Database pages that are evicted from the in-memory buffer cache are cached in local storage to speed subsequent retrieval of that data.\n  Customers can get started with Optimized Reads through the AWS Management Console, CLI, and SDK by modifying their existing Aurora and RDS databases or creating a new database using R8gd or M8gd instances. These instances are available in the US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Europe (Spain, Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Regions.

      "description": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is launching flat-rate pricing plans with no overages for website delivery and security. The flat-rate plans, available with Amazon CloudFront, combine global content delivery with AWS WAF, DDoS protection, Amazon Route 53 DNS, Amazon CloudWatch Logs ingestion, and serverless edge compute into a simple monthly price with no overage charges. Each plan also includes monthly Amazon S3 storage credits to help offset your storage costs.\n  CloudFront flat-rate plans allow you to deliver your websites and applications without calculating costs across multiple AWS services. You won’t face the risk of overage charges, even if your website or application goes viral or faces a DDoS attack. Security features like WAF and DDoS protection are enabled by default, and additional configurations are simple to set up. When you serve your AWS applications through CloudFront instead of directly to the internet, your flat-rate plan covers the data transfer costs between your applications and your viewers for a simple monthly price without the worry of overages. This simplified pricing model is available alongside pay-as-you-go pricing for each CloudFront distribution, giving you the flexibility to choose the right pricing model and feature set for each application.\n  Plans are available in Free ($0/month), Pro ($15/month), Business ($200/month), and Premium ($1,000/month) tiers for new and existing CloudFront distributions. Select the plan tier with the features and usage allowances matching your application’s needs. To learn more, refer to the Launch Blog, Plans and Pricing, or CloudFront Developer Guide.

After S3 backup data resides in a vault for 60 days (or longer based on your settings), you can move it to the new low-cost warm storage tier. The low-cost tier provides the same performance and features as the warm storage tier, including ransomware protection, recovery, and auditing.\n \nUse the new low-cost warm storage tier to reduce storage costs for business, compliance or regulatory data you must retain long-term. With this launch, you can now configure automatic tiering for all S3 backups for all vaults in an account, a specific vault, or a bucket within a vault by setting an age threshold of 60 days or more. When you enable tiering, existing backup data beyond the threshold automatically moves to the low-cost warm tier, delivering immediate cost savings with no action required and no performance impact.\n \nThis low-cost storage tier is available in all AWS Regions where AWS Backup for Amazon S3 is available. There is a one-time transition fee when data moves to the low-cost warm tier.
