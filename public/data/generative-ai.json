      "description": "Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) now supports blueprint instruction optimization, enabling you to improve the accuracy of your custom field extraction using just a few example document assets with ground truth labels. BDA automates the generation of insights from unstructured multimodal content such as documents, images, audio, and videos for your GenAI-powered applications. Blueprint instruction optimization automatically refines the natural language instructions in your blueprints, helping you achieve production-ready accuracy in minutes without model training or fine-tuning.\n  With blueprint instruction optimization, you can now bring up to 10 representative document assets from your production workload and provide the correct, expected values for each field. Blueprint instruction optimization analyzes the differences between your expected results and the Data Automation inference results, and then refines the natural language instructions to improve extraction accuracy across your examples. For your intelligent document processing applications, you can now improve the accuracy of extracting insights such as invoice line items, contract terms, tax form fields, or medical billing codes. After optimization completes, you receive detailed evaluation metrics including exact match rates and F1 scores measured against your ground truth, giving you confidence that your blueprint is ready for production deployment. \n  Data Automation blueprint instruction optimization for documents is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Data Automation is supported. \n  To learn more, see the Bedrock Data Automation User Guide and the Amazon Bedrock Pricing page. To get started with blueprint instruction optimization, navigate to your blueprint in the Amazon Bedrock console, go to Data Automation, select your custom outputs for documents, and select Start Optimization.",

      "description": "AWS Security Incident Response now offers integration with the cloud-based team collaboration platform Slack, enabling you to prepare for, respond to, and recover from security events faster and more effectively while maintaining your existing notification and communication workflows. With the bidirectional integration, you can create and update cases in both the Security Incident Response console and Slack with automatic data replication. Each Security Incident Response case is represented as a dedicated Slack channel, while comments and attachments sync instantly. This gives responders immediate access to critical case information and enables more efficient collaboration regardless of tool preference.\n  The integration helps security teams engage faster and accelerate response times by automatically adding Security Incident Response watchers to the corresponding Slack channel. This integration is available as an open-source solution on GitHub, providing customers and partners the opportunity to customize and extend the functionality. The integration leverages EventBridge which allows customers to continue using their existing security incident management and notification tooling, while leveraging AWS Security Incident Response capabilities. The solution features a modular architecture, and includes guidance on how to use Amazon Q Developer, Kiro, or similar AI assistants that help make it easy to add new integration targets beyond Slack.\n  To get started with the AWS Security Incident Response Slack integration, visit our GitHub repository.

With this feature, Quick Suite remembers the preferences users specify in chat and generate responses that are tailored to them. Users can also view their inferred preferences and remove any memory they don’t want Quick chat agents to use.\n  Previously, chat users needed to repeat their preferences around response format, acronyms, dashboards, and integrations in every conversation. They also had to clarify ambiguous topics and entities in chat, increasing the tedious back and forth needed to get accurate and insightful responses. Memory addresses this pain point by remembering facts and details about users in a way that ensures responses provided to users continuously learn and improve. Users also control what Quick Suite remembers about them – all the memories are viewable and removable by users, and users have the choice to start chat in Private Mode in which conversations are not used to infer memories.\n  Memory in Quick Suite chat agents is available in US East (N.

      "description": "Today, we’re announcing enhanced network policy capabilities in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), allowing customers to improve the network security posture for their Kubernetes workloads and their integrations with cluster-external destinations. This enhancement builds on network segmentation features previously supported in EKS. Now you can centrally enforce network access filters across the entire cluster, as well as leverage Domain Name System (DNS) based policies to secure egress traffic from your cluster’s environment.\n  As customers continue to scale their application environments using EKS, network traffic isolation is increasingly fundamental for preventing unauthorized access to resources inside and outside the cluster. To address this, EKS introduced support for Kubernetes NetworkPolicies in the Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (VPC CNI) plugin, allowing you to segment pod-to-pod communication at a namespace level. Now you can further strengthen the defensive posture for your Kubernetes network environment by centrally managing network filters for the whole cluster. Also, cluster admins now have a more stable and predictable approach for preventing unauthorized access to cluster-external resources in the cloud or on-prem using egress rules that filter traffic to external endpoints based on their Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).\n  These new network security features are available in all commercial AWS Regions for new EKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.29 or later, with support for existing clusters to follow in the coming weeks. ClusterNetworkPolicy is available in all EKS cluster launch modes using VPC CNI v1.21.0 or later. DNS-based policies are only supported in EKS Auto Mode-launched EC2 instances. To learn more, visit the Amazon EKS documentation or read the launch blog post here.",
