This new capability enables customers to allocate per-user monthly subscription and on-demand fees of AWS applications, such as Amazon Q Business, Amazon Q Developer, and Amazon QuickSight, to respective internal business units.\n  Customers should import their workforce users’ attributes to IAM Identity Center, the recommended service for managing workforce access to AWS applications. After importing the attributes, customers can enable one or more of these attributes as cost allocation tags from the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. When users access AWS applications, their usage and cost are automatically recorded with selected attributes. Cloud Financial Operations (FinOps) professionals can view and analyze costs in AWS Cost Explorer and AWS CUR 2.0, gaining visibility into how different teams drive AWS usage and costs.\n  Support for cost allocation using user attributes is generally available in all AWS Regions, excluding GovCloud (US) Regions and China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia) Regions.\n  To learn more, see organizing and tracking cost using AWS cost allocation tags.",

      "description": "Today, we’re announcing enhanced network policy capabilities in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), allowing customers to improve the network security posture for their Kubernetes workloads and their integrations with cluster-external destinations. This enhancement builds on network segmentation features previously supported in EKS. Now you can centrally enforce network access filters across the entire cluster, as well as leverage Domain Name System (DNS) based policies to secure egress traffic from your cluster’s environment.\n  As customers continue to scale their application environments using EKS, network traffic isolation is increasingly fundamental for preventing unauthorized access to resources inside and outside the cluster. To address this, EKS introduced support for Kubernetes NetworkPolicies in the Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (VPC CNI) plugin, allowing you to segment pod-to-pod communication at a namespace level. Now you can further strengthen the defensive posture for your Kubernetes network environment by centrally managing network filters for the whole cluster. Also, cluster admins now have a more stable and predictable approach for preventing unauthorized access to cluster-external resources in the cloud or on-prem using egress rules that filter traffic to external endpoints based on their Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).\n  These new network security features are available in all commercial AWS Regions for new EKS clusters running Kubernetes version 1.29 or later, with support for existing clusters to follow in the coming weeks. ClusterNetworkPolicy is available in all EKS cluster launch modes using VPC CNI v1.21.0 or later. DNS-based policies are only supported in EKS Auto Mode-launched EC2 instances. To learn more, visit the Amazon EKS documentation or read the launch blog post here.",

This feature allows you to leverage the power of semantic search with minimal configuration effort.\n  Traditional lexical search only matches exact phrases, often missing relevant content. Automatic semantic enrichment understands context and meaning, delivering more relevant results. For example, a search for \"eco-friendly transportation options\" finds matches about \"electric vehicles\" or \"public transportation\"—even when these exact terms aren't present. This new capability handles all semantic processing automatically, eliminating the need to manage machine learning models. It supports both English-only and multi-lingual variants, covering 15 languages including Arabic, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, and more. You pay only for actual usage during data ingestion, billed as OpenSearch Compute Unit (OCU) - Semantic Search. View the pricing page for cost details and a pricing example.\n  This feature is now available for Amazon OpenSearch Service domains running OpenSearch version 2.19 or later. Currently, this feature supports non-VPC domains in the following AWS Regions: US East (N.

Customers can add up to three additional storage volumes in addition to the primary storage volume, each up to 64 TiB storage, to their database instance. Additional storage volumes can be added, scaled up, or removed from the database instance without application downtime, so customers have the flexibility to add and adjust storage volumes over time based on changing workload requirements.\n  With additional storage volumes, customers can continue to scale database storage beyond the maximum storage size available in the primary volume. Also, customers can temporarily add volumes when they have a short-term requirement for additional storage, such as for month-end data processing or importing data from local storage, and remove unused volumes when they are no longer required. Furthermore, customers can optimize cost performance by using a combination of high-performance Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) volumes and General Purpose (gp3) volumes for their database instance. For example, data that requires consistent IOPS performance can be stored on an io2 volume, and infrequently accessed historical data can be stored on a gp3 volume to optimize storage cost.\n  To get started, customers can create additional storage volumes in a new or existing database instance through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.

You no longer need to configure local disk type and size for each application. EMR Serverless automatically handles intermediate data operation such as shuffle with no local storage charges. You pay only for compute and memory resources your job consumes.\n  EMR Serverless offloads intermediate data operations to a fully managed, auto-scaling serverless storage that encrypts data in transit and at rest with job-level isolation. Serverless storage decouples storage from compute, allowing Spark to release workers immediately when idle rather than keeping workers active to preserve temporary data. It eliminates job failures from insufficient disk capacity and reduces costs by avoiding idle worker charges. This is particularly valuable for jobs using dynamic resource allocation, such as recommendation engines processing millions of customer interactions, where initial stages process large datasets with high parallelism then narrow as data aggregates.\n  This feature is generally available for EMR release 7.12 and later.

GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms trained at AWS scale to automatically correlate security signals and detect critical threats. It analyzes multiple security signals across network activity, process runtime behavior, malware execution, and AWS API activity over extended periods to detect sophisticated attack patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n  With this launch, GuardDuty introduces two new critical-severity findings: AttackSequence:EC2/CompromisedInstanceGroup and AttackSequence:ECS/CompromisedCluster. These findings provide attack sequence information, allowing you to spend less time on initial analysis and more time responding to critical threats, minimizing business impact. For example, GuardDuty can identify suspicious processes followed by persistence attempts, crypto-mining activities, and reverse shell creation, representing these related events as a single, critical-severity finding. Each finding includes a detailed summary, events timeline, mapping to MITRE ATT&CK® tactics and techniques, and remediation recommendations.\n  While GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection is automatically enabled for GuardDuty customers at no additional cost, its detection comprehensiveness depends on your enabled GuardDuty protection plans. To improve attack sequence coverage and threat analysis of Amazon EC2 instances, enable Runtime Monitoring for EC2. To enable detection of compromised ECS clusters, enable Runtime Monitoring for Fargate or EC2 depending on your infrastructure type.\n  To get started, enable GuardDuty protection plans via the Console or API. New GuardDuty customers can start with a 30-day free trial, and existing customers who haven't used Runtime Monitoring can also try it free for 30 days.

This allows data teams to query catalog inventory and answer questions such as, \"How many assets were registered last month?\", \"Which assets are classified as confidential?\", or \"Which assets lack business descriptions?\" using standard SQL without building custom ETL infrastructure for reporting.\n \nThis capability automatically converts catalog asset metadata into a queryable table accessible from Amazon Athena, SageMaker Unified Studio notebooks, AI agents, and other analytics and BI tools. The exported table includes technical metadata (such as resource_id, resource_type), business metadata (such as asset_name, business_description), ownership details, and timestamps. Data is partitioned by snapshot_date for time travel queries and automatically appears in SageMaker Unified Studio under the aws-sagemaker-catalog bucket.\n \nThis capability is available in all AWS Regions where SageMaker Catalog is supported at no additional charge. You pay only for underlying services including S3 Tables storage and Amazon Athena queries. You can control storage costs by setting retention policies on the exported tables to automatically remove records older than your specified period.\n  To get started, activate dataset export using the AWS CLI, then access the asset table through S3 Tables or SageMaker Unified Studio's Data tab within 24 hours. Query using Amazon Athena, Studio notebooks, or connect external BI tools through the S3 Tables Iceberg REST Catalog endpoint. For instructions, see the Amazon SageMaker user guide.",

      "description": "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime now supports bi-directional streaming, enabling real-time conversations where agents listen and respond simultaneously while handling interruptions and context changes mid-conversation. This feature eliminates conversational friction by enabling continuous, two-way communication where context is preserved throughout the interaction.\n  Traditional agents require users to wait for them to finish responding before providing clarification or corrections, creating stop-start interactions that break conversational flow and feel unnatural, especially in voice applications. Bi-directional streaming addresses this limitation by enabling continuous context handling, helping power voice agents that deliver natural conversational experiences where users can interrupt, clarify, or change direction mid-conversation, while also enhancing text-based interactions through improved responsiveness. Built into AgentCore Runtime, this feature eliminates months of engineering effort required to build real-time streaming capabilities, so developers can focus on building innovative agent experiences rather than managing complex streaming infrastructure.\n  This feature is available in all nine AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime is available: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland).\n  To learn more about AgentCore Runtime bi-directional streaming, read the blog, visit the AgentCore documentation and get started with the AgentCore Starter Toolkit. With AgentCore Runtime's consumption-based pricing, you only pay for active resources consumed during agent execution, with no charges for idle time or upfront costs.",
