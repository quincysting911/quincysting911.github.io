      "description": "Starting today, Split Cost Allocation Data for Amazon EKS now allows you to import up to 50 Kubernetes custom labels per pod as cost allocation tags. You can attribute costs of your Amazon EKS cluster at the pod level using custom attributes, such as cost center, application, business unit, and environment in AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR).\n  With this new capability, you can better align your cost allocation with specific business requirements and organizational structure driven by your cloud financial management needs. This enables granular cost visibility of your EKS clusters running multiple application containers using shared EC2 instances, allowing you to allocate the shared costs of your EKS cluster. For new split cost allocation data customers, you can enable this feature in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. For existing customers, EKS will automatically import the labels, but you must activate them as cost allocation tags. After activation, Kubernetes custom labels are available in your CUR within 24 hours. You can use the Containers Cost Allocation dashboard to visualize the costs in Amazon QuickSight and the CUR query library to query the costs using Amazon Athena.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Split Cost Allocation Data for Amazon EKS is available.

      "description": "The AWS Serverless Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server now supports specialized tools for AWS Lambda event source mappings (ESM), helping developers configure and manage ESMs more efficiently. These new tools combine the power of AI assistance with Lambda ESM expertise to streamline how developers set up, optimize, and troubleshoot event-driven serverless applications built on Lambda.\n  We previously launched the open-source Serverless MCP Server to enhance how developers build modern applications with AI-powered contextual guidance for architecture decisions, infrastructure provisioning, deployment automation, and troubleshooting of serverless applications. Starting today, we’re expanding the MCP server’s capabilities with new ESM tools that empower AI assistants, like Amazon Q Developer and Kiro, with proven knowledge of ESM patterns and best practices. The new ESM tools translate high-level throughput, latency, and reliability requirements into specific ESM configurations, generate complete AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) templates with optimized settings, validate network topology for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)-based event sources, and diagnose common ESM issues. Thus, these tools enhance the event-driven application development experience, guiding developers through the entire ESM lifecycle, from initial setup to optimization and troubleshooting. \n  The key new ESM tools being added to the Serverless MCP Server are: the ESM guidance tool for contextual guidance across all supported event sources, the ESM optimization tool for analyzing configuration tradeoffs, and the ESM Kafka troubleshooting tool for specialized diagnostics with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) and self-managed Apache Kafka clusters.\n  To learn more about the Serverless MCP Server and how it can transform your AI-assisted application development, visit the launch blog post and documentation.

      "description": "Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser provides a fast, secure, cloud-based browser for AI agents to interact with websites at scale. It now enables agents to establish trusted, accountable access quickly and reduce CAPTCHA interruptions in automated workflows through Web Bot Auth, a draft IETF protocol that cryptographically identifies AI agents to websites. Traditional security measures like CAPTCHAs, rate limits, and blocks often halt automated workflows because Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) treat all automated traffic as suspicious - meaning AI agents frequently need human intervention to complete their tasks.\n  By enabling Web Bot Auth, AgentCore Browser streamlines bot verification across major security providers including Akamai Technologies, Cloudflare, and HUMAN Security. It automatically generates security credentials, signs HTTP requests with private keys, and registers verified identities - getting you started immediately without the need to register with multiple WAF providers or manage verification infrastructure.\n  Web Bot Auth support for AgentCore Browser is available in preview in all nine AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland).\n  Learn more about this feature through the blog, see the Reduce CAPTCHAs with Web Bot Auth documentation to get started with Web Bot Auth in Browser.

      "description": "AWS Lambda increases asynchronous invocations maximum payload size from 256 KB to 1 MB, allowing customers to ingest richer, complex payloads for their event-driven workloads without the need to split, compress, or externalize data. Customers invoke their Lambda functions asynchronously using either Lambda API directly, or by receiving push-based events from various AWS services like Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon SNS, Amazon EventBridge, AWS Step Functions.\n  Modern cloud applications increasingly rely on AWS Lambda’s asynchronous invocations and its integration with various AWS serverless services to build scalable, event-driven architectures. These applications often need to process rich contextual data, including large-language model prompts, telemetry signals, and complex JSON structures for machine learning outputs. With increase in maximum payload size to 1MB for asynchronous invocations, developers can streamline their architectures by including comprehensive data, from detailed user profiles to complete transaction histories, in a single event, eliminating the need for complex data chunking or external storage solutions.\n  This feature is generally available in all AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. Customers can start sending asynchronous invocation payloads up to 1 MB using Lambda’s invoke API. Customers are charged for 1 request per each asynchronous invocation for first 256 KB. Individual payload size beyond 256 KB is charged 1 additional request for each 64 KB of chunk up to 1 MB. To learn more, read Lambda asynchronous invocation documentation and AWS Lambda pricing.",

      "description": "Amazon Connect outbound campaigns now offers a preview dialing mode that gives agents more context about a customer before placing a call. Agents can see key customer information—such as name, account balance, and prior interactions—and choose the right moment to call. Campaign managers can tailor preview settings and monitor performance through new dashboards that bring visibility to agent behavior, campaign outcomes, and customer engagement trends.\n  Without proper context, agents struggle to personalize interactions, leading to low customer engagement and poor experiences. Additionally, businesses can face steep regulatory penalties under laws such as the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) or the UK Office of Communications (OFCOM) for delays in customer-agent connection.\n  With preview dialing, campaign managers can define review time limits and optionally enable contact removal from campaigns. During preview, agents see a countdown timer alongside customer data and can initiate calls at any moment. Analytics reveal performance patterns—such as average preview time or discard volume—giving managers data to optimize strategy and coach teams effectively. By reserving an agent prior to placing the call, companies can support compliance with regulations while bringing precision to outbound calling, improving both customer connection and operational control.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage. Preview dialing is available in AWS regions, including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London).\n  To learn more about configuring preview dialing, visit our webpage.",

This feature leverages machine learning models to help identify performance bottlenecks during the selected time period, and gives advice on what to do next.\n  Previously, database administrators had to manually analyze performance data, correlate metrics, and investigate root cause. This process is time-consuming and requires deep database expertise. With this launch, you can now analyze database performance monitoring data for any time period with automated intelligence. The feature automatically compares your selected time period against normal baseline performance, identifies anomalies, and provides specific remediation advice. Through intuitive visualizations and clear explanations, you can quickly identify performance issues and receive step-by-step guidance for resolution. This automated analysis and recommendation system reduces mean-time-to-diagnosis from hours to minutes.\n  You can get started with this feature by enabling the Advanced mode of CloudWatch Database Insights on your RDS for SQL Server databases using the RDS service console, AWS APIs, the AWS SDK, or AWS CloudFormation.
