      "title": "Amazon Connect outbound campaigns supports preview dialing for greater agent control",
      "description": "Amazon Connect outbound campaigns now offers a preview dialing mode that gives agents more context about a customer before placing a call. Agents can see key customer information—such as name, account balance, and prior interactions—and choose the right moment to call. Campaign managers can tailor preview settings and monitor performance through new dashboards that bring visibility to agent behavior, campaign outcomes, and customer engagement trends.\n  Without proper context, agents struggle to personalize interactions, leading to low customer engagement and poor experiences. Additionally, businesses can face steep regulatory penalties under laws such as the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) or the UK Office of Communications (OFCOM) for delays in customer-agent connection.\n  With preview dialing, campaign managers can define review time limits and optionally enable contact removal from campaigns. During preview, agents see a countdown timer alongside customer data and can initiate calls at any moment. Analytics reveal performance patterns—such as average preview time or discard volume—giving managers data to optimize strategy and coach teams effectively. By reserving an agent prior to placing the call, companies can support compliance with regulations while bringing precision to outbound calling, improving both customer connection and operational control.\n  With Amazon Connect outbound campaigns, companies pay-as-they-go for campaign processing and channel usage. Preview dialing is available in AWS regions, including US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (London).\n  To learn more about configuring preview dialing, visit our webpage.",

      "description": "Amazon CloudWatch Database Insights expands the availability of its on-demand analysis experience to the RDS for SQL Server database engine. CloudWatch Database Insights is a monitoring and diagnostics solution that helps database administrators and developers optimize database performance by providing comprehensive visibility into database metrics, query analysis, and resource utilization patterns. This feature leverages machine learning models to help identify performance bottlenecks during the selected time period, and gives advice on what to do next.\n  Previously, database administrators had to manually analyze performance data, correlate metrics, and investigate root cause. This process is time-consuming and requires deep database expertise. With this launch, you can now analyze database performance monitoring data for any time period with automated intelligence. The feature automatically compares your selected time period against normal baseline performance, identifies anomalies, and provides specific remediation advice. Through intuitive visualizations and clear explanations, you can quickly identify performance issues and receive step-by-step guidance for resolution. This automated analysis and recommendation system reduces mean-time-to-diagnosis from hours to minutes.\n  You can get started with this feature by enabling the Advanced mode of CloudWatch Database Insights on your RDS for SQL Server databases using the RDS service console, AWS APIs, the AWS SDK, or AWS CloudFormation. Please refer to RDS documentation and Aurora documentation for information regarding the availability of Database Insights across different regions, engines and instance classes.",

Authors can now customize fonts for data labels and axes in supported charts, in addition to the previously supported font customization for visual titles, subtitles, and legend, as well as tables and pivot tables headers.\n  Authors can set the font size (in pixels), font family, color, and styling options like bold, italics, and underline across analysis, including dashboards, reports and embedded scenarios. With this update, you can further align your dashboard's fonts with your organization's branding guidelines, creating a more cohesive and visually appealing experience. Additionally, the expanded font customization options help improve readability, especially when viewing visualizations on large screens.\n  This is now available in all supported Amazon Quick Suite regions.\n  To learn more about this, visit Amazon Quick Suite Visual formatting guide.",

Customers can now use ElastiCache to index, search, and update billions of high-dimensional vector embeddings from popular providers like Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, Anthropic, and OpenAI with latency as low as microseconds and up to 99% recall.\n  Key use cases include semantic caching for large language models (LLMs) and multi-turn conversational agents, which significantly reduce latency and cost by caching semantically similar queries. Vector search for ElastiCache also powers agentic AI systems with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure highly relevant results and consistently low latency across multiple retrieval steps. Additional use cases include recommendation engines, anomaly detection, and other applications that require efficient search across multiple data modalities.\n  Vector search for ElastiCache is available with Valkey version 8.2 on node-based clusters in all AWS Regions at no additional cost. To get started, create a Valkey 8.2 cluster using the AWS Management Console, AWS Software Development Kit (SDK), or AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). You can also use vector search on your existing clusters by upgrading from any version of Valkey or Redis OSS to Valkey 8.2 in a few clicks with no downtime. To learn more about vector search for ElastiCache for Valkey read this blog and for a list of supported commands see the ElastiCache documentation.",
