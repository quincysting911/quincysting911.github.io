      "description": "Amazon Connect now supports in-app notifications in the workspace header, visible from any page, so your team can stay informed without interrupting their workflow— whether configuring, analyzing data, or servicing customers. A notification icon appears in the header of every workspace page, with a badge indicating unread messages. Click the icon to view messages, access relevant resources through embedded links, and manage read/unread status—all without navigating away from your current task. For example, if all supervisors need to complete a certain training by end of week, a notification can be published to non-compliant users to remind them.\n  The new notification APIs enable you to programmatically send targeted messages to specific audiences within your organization, ensuring teams stay aware of urgent updates, policy changes, and action items requiring immediate attention. Amazon Connect will also leverage this capability to deliver system updates and important announcements.\n  In-app notifications are available in all AWS regions where Amazon Connect is available and offer public API and AWS CloudFormation support. To learn more about in-app notifications, see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. To learn more about Amazon Connect, please visit the Amazon Connect website.",

Database administrators managing Amazon Redshift workloads can now allocate additional resources for their clusters to enable autonomics even during periods of high user activity, eliminating the need to manually schedule optimizations such as Automatic Table Optimization (ATO), Automatic Table Sorting (ATS), Auto Vacuum, and Auto Analyze.\n  This enhancement extends Amazon Redshift's autonomics capabilities to automatically leverage extra compute resources, to run reliably without impacting user workloads. It also includes a cost control feature for provisioned clusters, allowing database administrators to limit the amount of resources available to autonomics. Additionally, the new SYS_AUTOMATIC_OPTIMIZATION system table enhances observability by providing detailed information on autonomics operations for both provisioned clusters and serverless workgroups.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Redshift is supported.
