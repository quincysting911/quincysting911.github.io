      "title": "Announcing Amazon Nova 2 Sonic for real-time conversational AI",
      "description": "Today, Amazon announces the availability of Amazon Nova 2 Sonic, our speech-to-speech model for natural, real-time conversational AI that delivers industry leading quality and price for voice-based conversational AI. It offers best-in-class streaming speech understanding with robustness to background noise and users’ speaking styles, efficient dialog handling, and speech generation with expressive voices that can speak natively in multiple languages (Polyglot voices). It has superior reasoning, instruction following, and tool invocation accuracy over the previous model.\n \nNova 2 Sonic builds on the capabilities introduced in the original Nova Sonic model with new features including expanded language support (Portuguese and Hindi), polyglot voices that enable the model to speak different languages with native expressivity using the same voice, and turn-taking controllability to allow developers to set low, medium, or high pause sensitivity. The model also adds cross-modal interaction, allowing users to seamlessly switch between voice and text in the same session, asynchronous tool calling to support multi-step tasks without interrupting conversation flow, and a one-million token context window for sustained interactions.\n \nDevelopers can integrate Nova Sonic 2 directly into real-time voice systems using Amazon Bedrock’s bidirectional streaming API. Nova Sonic 2 now also seamlessly integrates with Amazon Connect and other leading telephony providers, including Vonage, Twilio, and AudioCodes, as well as open source frameworks such as LiveKit and Pipecat.\n \nAmazon Nova 2 Sonic is available in Amazon Bedrock in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Europe (Stockholm). To learn more, read the AWS News Blog and the Amazon Nova Sonic User Guide. To get started with Nova Sonic 2 in Amazon Bedrock, visit the Amazon Bedrock console.",

Connect enables you to blend deterministic and agentic experiences, allowing you to deploy these AI agents at scale, reliably and safely. With integration with advanced speech models from Amazon Nova Sonic, voice self-service experiences now deliver more natural and adaptive interactions. Connect's self-service voice AI agents understand not only what customers say but how they say it, adapting voice responses to match customer tone and sentiment while maintaining natural conversational pace across multiple languages and accents. For example, when a customer calls about an order issue, your AI agent can greet them by name, ask clarifying questions, look up their order status, and process a refund, with voice interactions that adapt to the customer's tone and respond expressively throughout the conversation. This enables your contact center to automate complex troubleshooting, account management, and consultative interactions while maintaining the ability to escalate to a live representative at any point.\n  Nova Sonic support with Amazon Connect is available in two commercial AWS Regions: US East (N.

Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases offers managed, end-to-end Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows to create accurate, low latency, and custom Generative AI applications by incorporating contextual information from your company's data sources. Supporting multimodal retrieval in Knowledge Bases enables developers to build AI-powered search and question-answering applications that work across text, images, audio, and video files. For example, a user could ask their assistant \"show me Q1 projections for Amazon Bedrock\" and Bedrock Knowledge Bases will retrieve relevant text from documents, graphs, video snippets, and audio related to revenue projections for Bedrock, allowing the assistant to generate richer and more complete answers for the end user. Previously, customers could only search through text documents and images. Now they can unlock insights from all their enterprise data formats through one unified, fully managed workflow.\n \nOrganizations struggle to extract insights from their growing multimedia data—videos, audio recordings, images, and documents— because building AI applications that can search across these different modalities is complex. As a result, valuable information trapped in terabytes of meeting recordings, training videos, and visual documentation remains inaccessible, preventing organizations from making data-driven decisions quickly and accurately. With multimodal retrieval for Knowledge Bases, developers can ingest multimodal content with full control of the parsing, chunking, embedding (e.g. Amazon Nova multimodal), and vector storage options. From there, they can then send a text query or an image as input and get relevant text, image, audio, and video segments back in order to generate a response in their generative AI applications using their choice of LLM.\n \nFor more information about creating multimodal Knowledge Bases in Bedrock, please refer to the documentation. Region availability is dependent on the features selected for multimodal support, please refer to the documentation for details.",
