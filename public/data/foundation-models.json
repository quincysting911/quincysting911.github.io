      "description": "Amazon Bedrock now provides immediate access to all serverless foundation models by default for users in all commercial AWS regions. This update eliminates the need for manually activating model access, allowing you to instantly start using these models through the Amazon Bedrock console playground, AWS SDK, and Amazon Bedrock features including Agents, Flows, Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, Prompt Management, and Evaluations.\n  While you can quickly begin using serverless foundation models from most providers, Anthropic models, although enabled by default, still require you to submit a one-time usage form before first use. You can complete this form either through the API or through the Amazon Bedrock console by selecting an Anthropic model from the playground. When completed through the AWS organization management account, the form submission automatically enables Anthropic models across all member accounts in the organization.\n  This simplified access is available across all commercial AWS regions where Amazon Bedrock is supported. Account administrators retain full control over model access through IAM policies and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict access as needed. For implementation guidance and examples on access controls, please refer to our blog.",
