      "title": "Structured outputs now available in Amazon Bedrock",
      "description": "Amazon Bedrock now supports structured outputs, a capability that provides consistent, machine-readable responses from foundation models that adhere to your defined JSON schemas. Instead of prompting for valid JSON and adding extra checks in your application, you can specify the format you want and receive responses that match it—making production workflows more predictable and resilient.\n  Structured outputs helps with common production tasks such as extracting key fields and powering workflows that use APIs or tools, where small formatting errors can break downstream systems. By ensuring schema compliance, it reduces the need for custom validation logic and lowers operational overhead through fewer failed requests and retries—so you can confidently deploy AI applications that require predictable, machine-readable outputs. You can use structured outputs in two ways: define a JSON schema that describes the response format you want, or use strict tool definitions to ensure a model’s tool calls match your specifications.\n  Structured outputs is generally available for Anthropic Claude 4.5 models and select open-weight models across the Converse, ConverseStream, InvokeModel, and InvokeModelWithResponseStream APIs in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock is supported. To learn more about structured outputs and the supported models, visit the Amazon Bedrock documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker JumpStart now enables one-click deployment of four NVIDIA NIMs models purpose-built for biosciences and physical AI: ProteinMPNN, Nemotron-3.5B-Instruct, MSA Search NIM, and Cosmos Reason. NVIDIA NIM™ provides prebuilt, optimized inference microservices for rapidly deploying the latest AI models on any NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure. These models bring advanced capabilities spanning protein design, reasoning with configurable outputs, and physical world understanding, enabling customers to accelerate biosciences research, drug discovery, and embodied AI applications on AWS infrastructure.\n \nProteinMPNN enables fast and efficient protein sequence optimization guided by structural data. This NIM generates high-quality sequences with enhanced binding affinity and stability, validated through experimental results. Designed for scalability and flexibility, ProteinMPNN integrates seamlessly into protein engineering workflows, transforming applications like enzyme design and therapeutic development.\n \nMSA Search NIM supports GPU-accelerated Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of a query amino acid sequence against a set of protein sequence databases. These databases are searched for similar sequences to the query and then the collection of sequences are aligned to establish similar regions even when the proteins have different lengths and motifs.\n \nNemotron-3.5B-Instruct delivers high reasoning performance, native tool calling support, and extended context processing with 256k token context window. This model employs an efficient hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture to ensure higher throughput than its predecessors for agentic and coding workloads, while maintaining the reasoning depth of a larger model. It is ideal for building multi-agent workflows, developer productivity tools, processes automation, and for scientific and mathematical reasoning analysis, amongst others.\n \nCosmos Reason is an open , customizable, reasoning vision language model (VLM) for physical AI and robotics. It enables robots and vision AI agents to reason like humans, using prior knowledge, physics understanding, and common sense to understand and act in the real world. This model understands space, time, and fundamental physics, and can serve as a planning model to reason what steps an embodied agent might take next.\n \nWith SageMaker JumpStart, customers can deploy any of these models with just a few clicks to address their specific AI use cases.\n \nTo get started with these models, navigate to the SageMaker JumpStart model catalog in the SageMaker console or use the SageMaker Python SDK to deploy the models to your AWS account.

With this update, you can extend the persistence of cached prompt prefixes from the default 5 minutes to 1 hour, improving cost efficiency and performance for long-running agentic workflows and multi-turn conversations.\n  Previously, cached content remained active for a fixed 5-minute window and refreshed when reused. With the new 1-hour TTL option, you can maintain context for users who interact less frequently, or for complex agents that require more time between steps—such as tool use, retrieval, and orchestration. The 1-hour TTL is also useful for longer sessions and batch processing where you want cached content to persist across extended periods.\n  1-hour TTL prompt caching is generally available for Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Haiku 4.5, and Claude Opus 4.5 in all commercial AWS Regions and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions where these models are available. The 1-hour cache is billed at a different rate than the standard 5-minute cache. To learn more, refer to the Amazon Bedrock documentation and Amazon Bedrock Pricing page.",

SageMaker HyperPod helps you provision resilient clusters for running AI/ML workloads and developing state-of-the-art models such as large language models (LLMs), diffusion models, and foundation models (FMs).\n  When lifecycle scripts encounter issues during cluster creation or node operations, you now receive detailed error messages that include the specific CloudWatch log group and log stream names where you can find execution logs for lifecycle scripts. You can view these error messages by running the DescribeCluster API or by viewing the cluster details page in the SageMaker console. The console also provides a \"View lifecycle script logs\" button that navigates directly to the relevant CloudWatch log stream, making it easier to locate logs. Additionally, CloudWatch logs for lifecycle scripts now include specific markers to help you track lifecycle script execution progress, including indicators for when the lifecycle script log begins, when scripts are being downloaded, when downloads complete, and when scripts succeed or fail. These markers help you quickly identify where issues occurred during the provisioning process. These enhancements reduce the time required to diagnose and fix lifecycle script failures, helping you get your HyperPod clusters up and running faster.\n  This feature is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is supported.

      "description": "Today, Amazon Bedrock introduces the expansion of the Reserved service tier designed for workloads requiring predictable performance and guaranteed tokens-per-minute capacity. The Reserved tier provides the ability to reserve prioritized compute capacity, keeping service levels predictable for your mission critical applications. It also includes the flexibility to allocate different input and output tokens-per-minute capacities to match the exact requirements of your workload and control cost. This is particularly valuable because many workloads have asymmetric token usage patterns. For instance, summarization tasks consume many input tokens but generate fewer output tokens, while content generation applications require less input and more output capacity. When your application needs more tokens-per-minute capacity than what you reserved , the service automatically overflows to the pay-as-you-go Standard tier, ensuring uninterrupted operations. The Reserved tier is available today for Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 in AWS GovCloud (US-West). Customers can reserve capacity for 1 month or 3 month duration. Customers pay a fixed price per 1K tokens-per-minute and are billed monthly. Amazon Bedrock Reserved Tier is available for customers in AWS GovCloud (US-West) via GOV-CRIS cross-region profile.\n  With the expansion of the Reserved service tier, Amazon Bedrock continues to provide more choice to customers, helping them develop, scale, and deploy applications and agents that improve productivity and customer experiences while balancing performance and cost requirements.\n  For more information about the AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock Reserved tier is available, refer to the Documentation.
