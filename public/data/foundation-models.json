      "description": "Amazon Bedrock now provides immediate access to all serverless foundation models by default for users in all commercial AWS regions. This update eliminates the need for manually activating model access, allowing you to instantly start using these models through the Amazon Bedrock console playground, AWS SDK, and Amazon Bedrock features including Agents, Flows, Guardrails, Knowledge Bases, Prompt Management, and Evaluations.\n  While you can quickly begin using serverless foundation models from most providers, Anthropic models, although enabled by default, still require you to submit a one-time usage form before first use. You can complete this form either through the API or through the Amazon Bedrock console by selecting an Anthropic model from the playground. When completed through the AWS organization management account, the form submission automatically enables Anthropic models across all member accounts in the organization.\n  This simplified access is available across all commercial AWS regions where Amazon Bedrock is supported. Account administrators retain full control over model access through IAM policies and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to restrict access as needed. For implementation guidance and examples on access controls, please refer to our blog.",

      "description": "Amazon Bedrock now offers Cohere Embed v4, the latest state-of-the-art multimodal embedding model from Cohere that produces high-quality embeddings for text, images, and complex business documents. This powerful addition to Amazon Bedrock enables enterprises to build AI applications with frontier search and retrieval capabilities.\n  Traditional embedding models often struggle to understand complex multimodal business materials, such as business presentations and sales and financial reports, requiring extensive data pre-processing pipelines. Embed v4 addresses this challenge by natively processing documents with tables, graphs, diagrams, code snippets, and even handwritten notes. The model handles real-world imperfections such as spelling errors and formatting issues, eliminating the need for time-consuming data cleanup and helping you surface insights from previously difficult-to-search information.\n  With support for over 100 languages, including Arabic, English, French, Japanese, and Korean, Embed v4 enables global organizations to seamlessly search for information, breaking language barriers. The model is also fine-tuned for industries such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing, delivering superior performance on specialized documents including financial reports, medical records, and product specifications.\n  Cohere Embed v4 is available for on-demand inference in US East (N. Virginia), Europe (Ireland), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and can be accessed from select public AWS Regions through cross-region inference. Review the Amazon Bedrock Model Support by Regions guide for complete regional availability. To get started, visit the Amazon Bedrock console to request model access. For more information, refer to the Cohere product page and documentation.",
