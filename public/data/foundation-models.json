      "description": "Amazon Bedrock now supports Responses API on new OpenAI API-compatible service endpoints. Responses API enables developers to achieve asynchronous inference for long-running inference workloads, simplifies tool use integration for agentic workflows, and also supports stateful conversation management. Instead of requiring developers to pass the entire conversation history with each request, Responses API enables them to automatically rebuild context without manual history management. These new service endpoints support both streaming and non-streaming modes, enable reasoning effort support within Chat Completions API, and require only a base URL change for developers to integrate within existing codebases with OpenAI SDK compatibility.\n  \n Chat Completions with reasoning effort support is available for all Amazon Bedrock models powered by Project Mantle, a new distributed inference engine for large-scale machine learning model serving on Amazon Bedrock. Project Mantle simplifies and expedites onboarding of new models onto Amazon Bedrock, provides highly performant and reliable serverless inference with sophisticated quality of service controls, unlocks higher default customer quotas with automated capacity management and unified pools, and provides out-of-the-box compatibility with OpenAI API specifications. Responses API support is available today starting with OpenAI's GPT OSS 20B/120B models, with support for other models coming soon.\n To get started, visit the service documentation here",

      "description": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) announces a new serverless model customization capability that empowers AI developers to quickly customize popular models with supervised fine-tuning and the latest techniques like reinforcement learning. Amazon SageMaker AI is a fully managed service that brings together a broad set of tools to enable high-performance, low-cost AI model development for any use case. \n \nMany AI developers seek to customize models with proprietary data for improved accuracy, but this often requires lengthy iteration cycles. For example, AI developers must define a use case and prepare data, select a model and customization technique, train the model, then evaluate the model for deployment. Now AI developers can simplify the end-to-end model customization workflow, from data preparation to evaluation and deployment, and accelerate the process. With an easy-to-use interface, AI developers can quickly get started and customize popular models, including Amazon Nova, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, and GPT-OSS, with their own data. They can use supervised fine-tuning and the latest customization techniques such as reinforcement learning and direct preference optimization. In addition, AI developers can use the AI agent-guided workflow (in preview), and use natural language to generate synthetic data, analyze data quality, and handle model training and evaluation—all entirely serverless. \n \nYou can use this easy-to-use interface in the following AWS Regions: Europe (Ireland), US East (N. Virginia), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and US West (Oregon). To join the waitlist to access the AI agent-guided workflow, visit the sign-up page. \n \nTo learn more, visit the SageMaker AI model customization page and blog.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now supports elastic training, enabling organizations to accelerate foundation model training by automatically scaling training workloads based on resource availability and workload priorities. This represents a fundamental shift from training with a fixed set of resources, as it saves hours of engineering time spent reconfiguring training jobs based on compute availability.\n \nAny change in compute availability previously required manually halting training, reconfiguring training parameters, and restarting jobs—a process that requires distributed training expertise and leaves expensive AI accelerators sitting idle during training job reconfiguration. Elastic training automatically expands training jobs to absorb idle AI accelerators and seamlessly contracting when higher-priority workloads need resources—all without halting training entirely.\n \nBy eliminating manual reconfiguration overhead and ensuring continuous utilization of available compute, elastic training can help save time previously spent on infrastructure management, reduce costs by maximizing cluster utilization, and accelerate time-to-market. Training can start immediately with minimal resources and grow opportunistically as capacity becomes available.\n \nSageMaker HyperPod is available in all regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is currently available. Organizations can enable elastic training with zero code changes using HyperPod recipes for publicly available models including Llama and GPT OSS. For custom model architectures, customers can integrate elastic training capabilities through lightweight configuration updates and minimal code modifications, making it accessible to teams without requiring distributed systems expertise.\n \nTo get started, visit the Amazon SageMaker HyperPod product page and see the elastic training documentation for implementation guidance.",

      "description": "Amazon Bedrock now supports reinforcement fine-tuning, helping you improve model accuracy without needing deep machine learning expertise or large sums of labeled data. Amazon Bedrock automates the reinforcement fine-tuning workflow, making this advanced model customization technique accessible to everyday developers. Models learn to align with your specific requirements using a small set of prompts rather than the large sums of data needed for traditional fine-tuning methods, enabling teams to get started quickly. This capability teaches models through feedback on multiple possible responses to the same prompt, improving their judgement of what makes a good response. Reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock delivers 66% accuracy gains on average over base models so you can use smaller, faster, and more cost-effective model variants while maintaining high quality.\n \nOrganizations struggle to adapt AI models to their unique business needs, forcing them to choose between generic models with average performance or expensive, complex customization that requires specialized talent, infrastructure, and risky data movement. Reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock removes this complexity by making advanced model customization fast, automated, and secure. You can train models by uploading training data directly from your computer or choose from datasets already stored in Amazon S3, eliminating the need for any labeled datasets. You can define reward functions using verifiable rule-based graders or AI-based judges along with built-in templates to optimize your models for both objective tasks such as code generation or math reasoning, and subjective tasks such as instruction following or chatbot interactions. Your proprietary data never leaves AWS's secure, governed environment during the entire customization process, mitigating security and compliance concerns.\n \nYou can get started with reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock through the Amazon Bedrock console and via the Amazon Bedrock APIs. At launch, you can use reinforcement fine-tuning with Amazon Nova 2 Lite with support for additional models coming soon. To learn more about reinforcement fine-tuning in Amazon Bedrock, read the launch blog, pricing page, and documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Connect is introducing agentic self-service capabilities that enable AI agents to understand, reason, and take action across voice and messaging channels to automate routine and complex customer service tasks. Connect enables you to blend deterministic and agentic experiences, allowing you to deploy these AI agents at scale, reliably and safely. With integration with advanced speech models from Amazon Nova Sonic, voice self-service experiences now deliver more natural and adaptive interactions. Connect's self-service voice AI agents understand not only what customers say but how they say it, adapting voice responses to match customer tone and sentiment while maintaining natural conversational pace across multiple languages and accents. For example, when a customer calls about an order issue, your AI agent can greet them by name, ask clarifying questions, look up their order status, and process a refund, with voice interactions that adapt to the customer's tone and respond expressively throughout the conversation. This enables your contact center to automate complex troubleshooting, account management, and consultative interactions while maintaining the ability to escalate to a live representative at any point.\n  Nova Sonic support with Amazon Connect is available in two commercial AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) and fully available in English and Spanish and in preview for French, Italian, and German. To learn more about this feature see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide and Amazon Connect pricing page. To learn more about Amazon Connect, the AWS cloud-based contact center, please visit the Amazon Connect website.",
