      "description": "In this post, we introduce checkpointless training on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod, a paradigm shift in model training that reduces the need for traditional checkpointing by enabling peer-to-peer state recovery. Results from production-scale validation show 80–93% reduction in recovery time (from 15–30 minutes or more to under 2 minutes) and enables up to 95% training goodput on cluster sizes with thousands of AI accelerators.",

Zero-ETL data replication and schema synchronization writes extracted data to AWS services like Amazon Redshift, Amazon SageMaker lakehouse, and Amazon S3 Tables, alleviating the need for manual pipeline development. In this post, we show how to create and monitor a zero-ETL integration with various ODP and non-ODP SAP sources.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance now supports self-service migration, allowing you to update your notebook instance platform identifier through the UpdateNotebookInstance API. This enables you to seamlessly transition from unsupported platform identifiers (notebook-al1-v1, notebook-al2-v1, notebook-al2-v2) to supported versions (notebook-al2-v3, notebook-al2023-v1).\n  With the new PlatformIdentifier parameter in the UpdateNotebookInstance API, you can update to newer versions of the Notebook instance platform while preserving your existing data and configurations. The platform identifier determines which Operating System and JupyterLab version combination your notebook instance runs. This self-service capability simplifies the migration process and helps you keep your notebook instances current.\n  This feature is supported through AWS CLI (version 2.31.27 or newer) and SDK, and is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker Notebook instances are supported. To learn more, see Update a Notebook Instance in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.",
