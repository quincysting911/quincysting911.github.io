      "description": "Today, we are excited to announce that Amazon SageMaker notebook instance supports Amazon Linux 2023. You can now choose Amazon Linux 2023 for your new Amazon SageMaker notebook instance to take advantage of the latest innovations, enhanced security features.\n  Amazon SageMaker notebook instances are fully managed Jupyter Notebooks with pre-configured development environments for data science and machine learning. Data scientists and developers can use SageMaker Notebooks to interactively explore, visualize and prepare data, and build and deploy machine learning models on SageMaker.\n  Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) is a general-purpose rpm-based Linux distribution and successor to Amazon Linux 2 (AL2). Amazon Linux 2023 simplifies operating system management through its secure, stable, and high-performance runtime environment. This Linux distribution follows a predictable two-year major release cycle with five years of long-term support. The first two years provide standard support with quarterly security patches, bug fixes, and new features, followed by three years of maintenance. Enhanced security features include SELinux support and FIPS 140-3 validation for cryptographic modules.\n  With this you now have the options to launch a notebook instance with AL2023 or AL2. For more details about this launch and instructions on how to get started with AL2023 notebook instances, please refer to the Amazon Linux 2023 documentation.",
