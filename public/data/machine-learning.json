      "description": "In this post, we demonstrate how to implement real-time fraud prevention using GraphStorm v0.5's new capabilities for deploying graph neural network (GNN) models through Amazon SageMaker. We show how to transition from model training to production-ready inference endpoints with minimal operational overhead, enabling sub-second fraud detection on transaction graphs with billions of nodes and edges.",
