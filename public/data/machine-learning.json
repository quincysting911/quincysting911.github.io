      "description": "Amazon SageMaker Catalog now supports metadata enforcement rules for glossary terms, requiring data producers to apply approved business vocabulary when publishing assets. This helps consistent data classification and improves discoverability across organizational catalogs.\n  This new capability allows administrators to define mandatory glossary term requirements for data assets during the publishing workflow. Data producers must now classify their assets with approved business terms from organizational glossaries before publication, ensuring consistent metadata standards and improving data discoverability. The enforcement rules validate that required glossary terms are applied, preventing assets from being published without proper business context. By standardizing metadata and aligning technical data schemas with business language, this capability enhances data governance, improves search relevance, and helps business users more easily understand and trust published data assets.\n  Metadata enforcement rules for glossary terms are available in all AWS regions where Amazon SageMaker Catalog operates.\n  To get started, visit the Amazon SageMaker console and navigate to the Catalog governance section to configure glossary term enforcement policies. You can also use the AWS CLI or SDKs to programmatically manage metadata rules for asset publishing. \n \nTo learn more about Amazon SageMaker Catalog, visit the Amazon Sagemaker documentation.",

We use the setup to illustrate how different IAM Identity Center users can run their Spark sessions, using each compute setup, within the same project in SageMaker Unified Studio. We show how each user will see only tables or part of tables that they’re granted access to in Lake Formation.",
