      "description": "In this post, we provide step-by-step instructions to set up Amazon EMR on EC2, EMR Serverless, and AWS Glue within SageMaker Unified Studio, enabled with trusted identity propagation. We use the setup to illustrate how different IAM Identity Center users can run their Spark sessions, using each compute setup, within the same project in SageMaker Unified Studio. We show how each user will see only tables or part of tables that they’re granted access to in Lake Formation.",
