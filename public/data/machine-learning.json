      "description": "Machine learning operations (MLOps) is the combination of people, processes, and technology to productionize ML use cases efficiently. To achieve this, enterprise customers must develop MLOps platforms to support reproducibility, robustness, and end-to-end observability of the ML use case’s lifecycle. Those platforms are based on a multi-account setup by adopting strict security constraints, development best […]",

      "description": "In this post, we demonstrate how to implement real-time fraud prevention using GraphStorm v0.5's new capabilities for deploying graph neural network (GNN) models through Amazon SageMaker. We show how to transition from model training to production-ready inference endpoints with minimal operational overhead, enabling sub-second fraud detection on transaction graphs with billions of nodes and edges.",

In this post, we walk through a hands-on, end-to-end example of developing, testing, and running a machine learning (ML) pipeline using workflow capabilities in Amazon SageMaker, accessed through the Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio experience. These workflows are powered by Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow.",
