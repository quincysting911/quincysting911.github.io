      "description": "AWS Glue zero-ETL with SAP now supports data ingestion and replication from SAP data sources such as Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) managed SAP Business Warehouse (BW) extractors, Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP), Core Data Services (CDS) views, and other non-ODP data sources. Zero-ETL data replication and schema synchronization writes extracted data to AWS services like Amazon Redshift, Amazon SageMaker lakehouse, and Amazon S3 Tables, alleviating the need for manual pipeline development. In this post, we show how to create and monitor a zero-ETL integration with various ODP and non-ODP SAP sources.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance now supports self-service migration, allowing you to update your notebook instance platform identifier through the UpdateNotebookInstance API. This enables you to seamlessly transition from unsupported platform identifiers (notebook-al1-v1, notebook-al2-v1, notebook-al2-v2) to supported versions (notebook-al2-v3, notebook-al2023-v1).\n  With the new PlatformIdentifier parameter in the UpdateNotebookInstance API, you can update to newer versions of the Notebook instance platform while preserving your existing data and configurations. The platform identifier determines which Operating System and JupyterLab version combination your notebook instance runs. This self-service capability simplifies the migration process and helps you keep your notebook instances current.\n  This feature is supported through AWS CLI (version 2.31.27 or newer) and SDK, and is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker Notebook instances are supported. To learn more, see Update a Notebook Instance in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker HyperPod now supports checkpointless training, a new foundational model training capability that mitigates the need for a checkpoint-based job-level restart for fault recovery. Checkpointless training maintains forward training momentum despite failures, reducing recovery time from hours to minutes. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional checkpoint-based recovery, where failures require pausing the entire training cluster, diagnosing issues manually, and restoring from saved checkpoints, a process that can leave expensive AI accelerators idle for hours, costing your organization wasted compute.\n \nCheckpointless training transforms this paradigm by preserving the model training state across the distributed cluster, automatically swapping out faulty training nodes on the fly and using peer-to-peer state transfer from healthy accelerators for failure recovery. By mitigating checkpoint dependencies during recovery, checkpointless training can help your organization save on idle AI accelerator costs and accelerate time. Even at larger scales, checkpointless training on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod enables upwards of 95% training goodput on cluster sizes with thousands of AI accelerators.\n \nCheckpointless training on SageMaker HyperPod is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon SageMaker HyperPod is currently available. You can enable checkpointless training with zero code changes using HyperPod recipes for popular publicly available models such as Llama and GPT OSS. For custom model architectures, you can integrate checkpointless training components with minimal modifications for PyTorch-based workflows, making it accessible to your teams regardless of their distributed training expertise.\n \nTo get started, visit the Amazon SageMaker HyperPod product page and see the checkpointless training GitHub page for implementation guidance.",

      "description": "Amazon SageMaker AI now offers a serverless MLflow capability that dynamically scales to support AI model development tasks. With MLflow, AI developers can begin tracking, comparing, and evaluating experiments without waiting for infrastructure setup.\n  As customers across industries accelerate AI development, they require capabilities to track experiments, observe behavior, and evaluate the performance of AI models, applications and agents. However, managing MLflow infrastructure requires administrators to continuously maintain and scale tracking servers, make complex capacity planning decisions, and deploy separate instances for data isolation. This infrastructure burden diverts resources away from core AI development and creates bottlenecks that impact team productivity and cost effectiveness.\n  With this update, MLflow now scales dynamically to deliver fast performance for demanding and unpredictable model development tasks, then scales down during idle time. Administrators can also enhance productivity by setting up cross-account access via Resource Access Manager (RAM) to simplify collaboration across organizational boundaries.\n  The serverless MLflow capability on Amazon SageMaker AI is offered at no additional charge and works natively with familiar Amazon SageMaker AI model development capabilities like SageMaker AI JumpStart, SageMaker Model Registry and SageMaker Pipelines. Customers can access the latest version of MLflow on Amazon SageMaker AI with automatic version updates.\n  Amazon SageMaker AI with MLflow is now available in select AWS Regions.
