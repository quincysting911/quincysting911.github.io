      "description": "You can now monitor Mountpoint operations in observability tools such as Amazon CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana. With this launch, Mountpoint emits near real-time metrics such as request count or request latency using OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), an open source data transmission protocol. This means you can use applications such as CloudWatch agent or the OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector to publish the metrics into observability tools and create dashboards for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n  Previously, Mountpoint emitted operational data into log files, and you needed to create custom tools to parse the log files for insights. Now, when you mount your Amazon S3 bucket, you can configure Mountpoint to publish the metrics to an observability tool to proactively monitor issues that might impact your applications. For example, you can check if an application is unable to access S3 due to permission issues by analyzing the S3 request error metric that provides error types at an Amazon EC2 instance granularity.\n  Follow the step-by-step instructions to set up the CloudWatch agent or the OTel collector and configure Mountpoint to publish metrics into an observability tool. For more information, visit the Mountpoint for Amazon S3 GitHub repository, Mountpoint product page, and Mountpoint for Amazon S3 CSI driver GitHub page.",

      "description": "Amazon Kinesis Data Streams launches On-demand Advantage, so customers can warm on-demand streams to handle instant throughput increases up to 10GB or 10 million events per second, eliminating the need to over-provision or build custom scaling solutions. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale. On-demand streams automatically scale capacity based on data usage, and now you can warm write capacity ad hoc. On-demand Advantage also provides a simpler pricing structure that removes the fixed, per-stream charge, so customers only pay for data usage at better rates.\n  On-demand Advantage offers data usage with 60% lower pricing compared to On-demand Standard, with data ingest at $0.032/GB and data retrieval at $0.016/GB in the US East (N. Virginia) region. The price of Enhanced fan-out data retrieval is the same as shared-throughput retrievals, making higher fan-out use cases more cost effective. The mode also decreases the price of extended retention by 77% from $0.10/GB-month to $0.023/GB-month. Once you enable On-demand Advantage mode, the account will be billed for a minimum of 25MB/s of data ingest and 25MB/s of data retrieval at the lower rates across all on-demand streams. The new pricing means On-demand Advantage is the most cost effective way to stream with Kinesis Data Streams when you ingest at least 10MB/s in aggregate, fan out to more than two consumer applications, or have hundreds of streams in a region. You can check directly in the Kinesis console and the pricing page if On-demand Advantage is a good fit for your account.\n  On-demand Advantage is available in all AWS regions where Kinesis Data Streams is available, including AWS GovCloud (US) and China regions. To learn more, see the launch blog and the Kinesis Data Streams User Guide.",

      "description": "AWS announces the general availability of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Capacity Reservation Topology API. It joins the Instance Topology API in enabling customers to efficiently manage capacity, schedule jobs, and rank nodes for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and High-Performance Computing distributed workloads. The Capacity Reservation Topology API gives customers a unique per-account hierarchical view of the relative location of their capacity reservations.\n \nCustomers running distributed parallel workloads are managing thousands of instances across tens to hundreds of capacity reservations. With the Capacity Reservation Topology API, customers can describe the topology of their reservations as a network node set, which will show the relative proximity of their capacity without the need to launch an instance. This enables efficient capacity planning and management as customers provision workloads on tightly coupled capacity. Customers can then use the Instance Topology API, which provides consistent network nodes from the Capacity Reservation Topology API with further granularity, enabling a consistent and seamless way to schedule jobs and rank nodes for optimal performance in distributed parallel workloads.\n \nThe Capacity Reservation Topology API is available in the following AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Spain), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Zurich), Middle East (Bahrain), Middle East (UAE), and South America (São Paulo), and it is supported on all instances available with the Instance Topology API.\n \nTo learn more, please visit the latest EC2 user guide.",

      "description": "Today, Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) announces a new query planner, featuring advanced query optimization capabilities and improved performance. PlannerVersion 2.0 for Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) 5.0 delivers up to 10x performance improvement over the prior version when using find and update operators with indexes. Performance improvements primarily come from using more optimal index plans and enabling index scan support for operators such as negation operators ($neq, $nin) and nested $elementMatch. PlannerVersion 2.0 queries run faster through better cost estimation techniques, optimized algorithms, and enhanced stability.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 also simplifies query syntax. For example, you no longer need to provide explicit hints for $regex queries to utilize indexes.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon DocumentDB 5.0 is supported. You can enable it by simply modifying the corresponding parameter in your cluster parameter group. The change does not require a cluster restart or cause any downtime. If needed, you can easily revert to using the legacy query planner. To learn more about the new query planner, see Getting Started with New Query Planner.",
