      "title": "Introducing the Capacity Reservation Topology API for AI, ML, and HPC instance types",
      "description": "AWS announces the general availability of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Capacity Reservation Topology API. It joins the Instance Topology API in enabling customers to efficiently manage capacity, schedule jobs, and rank nodes for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and High-Performance Computing distributed workloads. The Capacity Reservation Topology API gives customers a unique per-account hierarchical view of the relative location of their capacity reservations.\n \nCustomers running distributed parallel workloads are managing thousands of instances across tens to hundreds of capacity reservations. With the Capacity Reservation Topology API, customers can describe the topology of their reservations as a network node set, which will show the relative proximity of their capacity without the need to launch an instance. This enables efficient capacity planning and management as customers provision workloads on tightly coupled capacity. Customers can then use the Instance Topology API, which provides consistent network nodes from the Capacity Reservation Topology API with further granularity, enabling a consistent and seamless way to schedule jobs and rank nodes for optimal performance in distributed parallel workloads.\n \nThe Capacity Reservation Topology API is available in the following AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Africa (Cape Town), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (Ireland), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Spain), Europe (Stockholm), Europe (Zurich), Middle East (Bahrain), Middle East (UAE), and South America (São Paulo), and it is supported on all instances available with the Instance Topology API.\n \nTo learn more, please visit the latest EC2 user guide.",

      "title": "Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) announces upgraded query planner that can run queries up to 10x faster",
      "description": "Today, Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) announces a new query planner, featuring advanced query optimization capabilities and improved performance. PlannerVersion 2.0 for Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) 5.0 delivers up to 10x performance improvement over the prior version when using find and update operators with indexes. Performance improvements primarily come from using more optimal index plans and enabling index scan support for operators such as negation operators ($neq, $nin) and nested $elementMatch. PlannerVersion 2.0 queries run faster through better cost estimation techniques, optimized algorithms, and enhanced stability.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 also simplifies query syntax. For example, you no longer need to provide explicit hints for $regex queries to utilize indexes.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon DocumentDB 5.0 is supported. You can enable it by simply modifying the corresponding parameter in your cluster parameter group. The change does not require a cluster restart or cause any downtime. If needed, you can easily revert to using the legacy query planner. To learn more about the new query planner, see Getting Started with New Query Planner.",
