Businesses can monitor if the required number of evaluations for their agents have been completed, ensuring compliance with internal policies (e.g., complete 5 evaluations per agent per month), regulatory requirements, and labor union agreements. Additionally, businesses can analyze evaluation scoring patterns across different managers, to identify opportunities to improve evaluation consistency and accuracy. These insights are available in real-time through analytics dashboards in the Connect UI, and APIs.\n  This feature is available in all regions where Amazon Connect is offered.
