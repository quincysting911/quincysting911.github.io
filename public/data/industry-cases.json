With this release, Amazon ECS allows you to specify a user ID in the \"user\" field of your Firelens containerDefinition element of your Task Definition, instead of only allowing \"user\": \"0\" (root user).\n  The new capability is supported in all AWS Regions. See the documentation for using Firelens for more details on how to set up your Firelens container to run as non-root.",

      "description": "AWS for Fluent Bit announces version 3.0.0, based on Fluent Bit version 4.1.0 and Amazon Linux 2023. Container logging using AWS for Fluent Bit is now more performant and more feature-rich for AWS customers, including those using Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).\n  AWS for Fluent Bit enables Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS customers to collect, process, and route container logs to destinations including Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and Amazon S3 without changing application code. AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 upgrades the Fluent Bit version to 4.1.0, and upgrades the base image to Amazon Linux 2023. These updates deliver access to the latest Fluent Bit features, significant performance improvements, and enhanced security. New features include native OpenTelemetry (OTel) support for ingesting and forwarding OTLP logs, metrics, and traces with AWS SigV4 authenticationâ€”eliminating the need for additional sidecars. Performance improvements include faster JSON parsing, processing more logs per vCPU with lower latency. Security enhancements include TLS min version and cipher controls, which enforce your TLS policy on outputs from AWS for Fluent Bit for stronger protocol posture.\n  You can use AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 on both ECS and EKS. On ECS, update the FireLens log-router container image in your task definition to the 3.0.0 tag from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. On EKS, upgrade by either updating the Helm release or setting the DaemonSet image to the 3.0.0 version.\n  The AWS for Fluent Bit image is available in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery and in the Amazon ECR repository. You can also find it on GitHub for source code and additional guidance.",

This helps customers seamlessly present legal terms during user registration while simplifying implementation. With Managed Login, Cognito customers could previously use its no-code editor to customize the user journey from signup and login to password recovery and multi-factor authentication. Now, customers can additionally use Managed Login to easily set up terms of use and privacy policy documents, saving development teams from building custom solutions.\n  With this capability, you can configure terms of use and privacy policy URLs for each app client in your Cognito user pool. When users register, they see text indicating that by signing up, they agree to your terms of use and privacy policy, and a link to your webpage with the agreement. You can configure different URLs for each supported language to match your Managed Login localization settings. For example, if you have configured the privacy policy and terms of use documents for French (fr) and the same is selected in the lang query-parameter on the sign-up page URL, users will see the French URL you configured.\n  This capability is available to Amazon Cognito customers using the Essentials or Plus tiers in AWS Regions where Cognito is available, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. To learn more, refer to the developer guide and Pricing Detail Page for Cognito Essentials and Plus tier.",
