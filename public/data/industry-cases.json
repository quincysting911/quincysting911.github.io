      "description": "AWS is announcing the general availability of new Amazon EC2 M8azn instances, general purpose high-frequency high-network instances powered by fifth generation AMD EPYC (formerly code named Turin) processors, offering the highest maximum CPU frequency, 5GHz in the cloud. M8azn instances offer up to 2x compute performance compared to previous generation M5zn instances, and up to 24% higher performance than M8a instances.\n  M8azn instances deliver up to 4.3x higher memory bandwidth and 10x larger L3 cache compared to M5zn instances allowing latency-sensitive and compute-intensive workloads to achieve results faster. These instances also offer up to 2x networking throughput and up to 3x EBS throughput versus M5zn instances. Built on the AWS Nitro System using sixth generation Nitro Cards, these instances are ideal for applications such as real-time financial analytics, high-performance computing, high-frequency trading (HFT), CI/CD, intensive gaming, and simulation modeling for the automotive, aerospace, energy, and telecommunication industries. M8azn instances feature a 4:1 ratio of memory to vCPU and are available in 9 sizes ranging from 2 to 96 vCPUs with up to 384 GiB of memory, including two bare metal variants.\n  M8azn instances are available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Europe (Frankfurt) Regions. Customers can purchase these instances via Savings Plans, On-Demand instances, and Spot instances. To get started, sign in to the AWS Management Console. For more information visit the Amazon EC2 M8azn instance page.",
