      "description": "Amazon Route 53 is excited to release the accelerated recovery option for managing DNS records in public hosted zones. Accelerated recovery targets a 60-minute recovery time objective (RTO) for regaining the ability to make DNS changes to your DNS records in Route 53 public hosted zones, if AWS services in US East (N. Virginia) become temporarily unavailable.\n  The Route 53 public DNS service API is used by customers today for making changes to DNS records in order to facilitate software deployments, run infrastructure operations, and onboard new users. Customers in banking, financial technology (FinTech), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) in particular need a predictable and short RTO for meeting business continuity and disaster recovery objectives. In the past, if AWS services in US East (N. Virginia) became unavailable, customers would not be able to modify or recreate DNS records to point users and internal services to updated endpoints. Now, when you enable the accelerated recovery option on your Route 53 public hosted zone, you can make changes to Route 53 public DNS records (Resource Record Sets) in that hosted zone soon after such an interruption, most often in less than one hour.\n  Accelerated recovery for managing public DNS records is available globally, except in AWS GovCloud and Amazon Web Services in China. There is no additional charge for using this feature. To learn more about the accelerated recovery option, visit our documentation.",

      "description": "AWS launches VPC Encryption Controls to make it easy to audit and enforce encryption in transit within and across Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPC), and demonstrate compliance with encryption standards. You can turn it on your existing VPCs to monitor encryption status of traffic flows and identify VPC resources that are unintentionally allowing plaintext traffic. This feature also makes it easy to enforce encryption across different network paths by automatically (and transparently) turning on hardware-based AES-256 encryption on traffic between multiple VPC resources including AWS Fargate, Network Load Balancers, and Application Load Balancers.\n  To meet stringent compliance standards like HIPAA and PCI DSS, customers rely on both application layer encryption and the hardware-based encryption that AWS offers across different network paths. AWS provides hardware-based AES-256 encryption transparently between modern EC2 Nitro instances. AWS also encrypts all network traffic between AWS data centers in and across Availability Zones, and AWS Regions before the traffic leaves our secure facilities. All inter-region traffic that uses VPC Peering, Transit Gateway Peering, or AWS Cloud WAN receives an additional layer of transparent encryption before leaving AWS data centers. Prior to this release, customers had to track and confirm encryption across all network paths. With VPC Encryption Controls, customers can now monitor, enforce and demonstrate encryption within and across Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in just a few clicks. Your information security team can turn it on centrally to maintain a secure and compliant environment, and generate audit logs for compliance and reporting.\n  VPC Encryption Controls is now available in the following AWS Commercial regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Frankfurt), Europe (London), Europe (Paris), Europe (Milan), Europe (Zurich), Europe (Stockholm), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Melbourne), Asia Pacific (Hong Kong), Asia Pacific (Osaka), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Hyderabad), Asia Pacific (Jakarta), Canada West (Calgary), Canada (Central), Middle East (UAE), Middle East (Bahrain), Africa (Cape Town) and South America (São Paulo).
