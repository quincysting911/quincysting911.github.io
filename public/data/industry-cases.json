      "description": "Second-generation AWS Outposts racks can now be shipped and installed at your data center and on-premises locations in Argentina, Bangladesh, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Panama, Qatar, Senegal, Serbia, South Africa, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Uruguay.\n  Outposts racks extend AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any on-premises data center or colocation space for a truly consistent hybrid experience. Outposts racks are ideal for workloads requiring low-latency access to on-premises systems, local data processing, data residency compliance, and migration of applications with local system dependencies. Second-generation Outposts racks support the latest generation of x86-powered Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, starting with C7i, M7i, and R7i instances. These instances provide up to 40% better performance compared to C5, M5, and R5 instances on first-generation Outposts racks. Second-generation Outposts racks also offer simplified network scaling and configuration, and support a new category of accelerated networking Amazon EC2 instances optimized for ultra-low latency and high throughput needs.\n  With the availability of second-generation Outposts racks in the above countries, you can run AWS services locally in your on-premises facilities to maintain data residency within your country, while connecting to a supported AWS Region for management and operations.\n  To learn more about second-generation Outposts racks, read this blog post and user guide. For the most updated list of countries and territories and the AWS Regions where second-generation Outposts racks are supported, check out the Outposts rack FAQs page.",

      "description": "Amazon Connect now offers customers the ability to view status of agent screen recordings in near real time in CloudWatch using Amazon EventBridge. With screen recording, supervisors can identify areas for agent coaching (e.g., non-compliance with business processes) by not only listening to customer calls or reviewing chat transcripts, but also watching agents’ actions while handling a contact (i.e., a voice call, chat and task). Using Amazon EventBridge, customers can see status of each agent screen recording including success/failure, failure codes with description, installed client version, agent web browser version, agent operating system, screen recording start and end times from CloudWatch.\n  Customers can start using Amazon Connect screen recording status tracking by subscribing to Screen Recording Status Changed event type in Amazon EventBridge event bus.\n  Screen recording status tracking is available in all the AWS Regions where Amazon Connect is already available. To learn more about screen recording, please visit the documentation and webpage. For information about screen recording pricing, visit the Amazon Connect pricing page.",

With this launch, you can now import your historical CloudTrail Lake data into CloudWatch with a few steps enabling you to easily consolidate operational, security, and compliance data in one place. In CloudWatch, you simply specify the CloudTrail Lake event data store (EDS), and the date range to initiate import of your CloudTrail data. Simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data is supported via the AWS console, CLI, and SDK.\n  While simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data is available at no additional cost, you incur CloudWatch fees based on custom logs pricing. To learn more about simplified import of CloudTrail Lake data and supported AWS regions, visit the Amazon CloudWatch documentation.",
