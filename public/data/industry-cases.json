      "title": "Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) announces upgraded query planner that can run queries up to 10x faster",
      "description": "Today, Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) announces a new query planner, featuring advanced query optimization capabilities and improved performance. PlannerVersion 2.0 for Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) 5.0 delivers up to 10x performance improvement over the prior version when using find and update operators with indexes. Performance improvements primarily come from using more optimal index plans and enabling index scan support for operators such as negation operators ($neq, $nin) and nested $elementMatch. PlannerVersion 2.0 queries run faster through better cost estimation techniques, optimized algorithms, and enhanced stability.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 also simplifies query syntax. For example, you no longer need to provide explicit hints for $regex queries to utilize indexes.\n \nPlannerVersion 2.0 is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon DocumentDB 5.0 is supported. You can enable it by simply modifying the corresponding parameter in your cluster parameter group. The change does not require a cluster restart or cause any downtime. If needed, you can easily revert to using the legacy query planner. To learn more about the new query planner, see Getting Started with New Query Planner.",

With this release, Amazon ECS allows you to specify a user ID in the \"user\" field of your Firelens containerDefinition element of your Task Definition, instead of only allowing \"user\": \"0\" (root user).\n  The new capability is supported in all AWS Regions.

      "description": "AWS for Fluent Bit announces version 3.0.0, based on Fluent Bit version 4.1.0 and Amazon Linux 2023. Container logging using AWS for Fluent Bit is now more performant and more feature-rich for AWS customers, including those using Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).\n  AWS for Fluent Bit enables Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS customers to collect, process, and route container logs to destinations including Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and Amazon S3 without changing application code. AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 upgrades the Fluent Bit version to 4.1.0, and upgrades the base image to Amazon Linux 2023. These updates deliver access to the latest Fluent Bit features, significant performance improvements, and enhanced security. New features include native OpenTelemetry (OTel) support for ingesting and forwarding OTLP logs, metrics, and traces with AWS SigV4 authenticationâ€”eliminating the need for additional sidecars. Performance improvements include faster JSON parsing, processing more logs per vCPU with lower latency. Security enhancements include TLS min version and cipher controls, which enforce your TLS policy on outputs from AWS for Fluent Bit for stronger protocol posture.\n  You can use AWS for Fluent Bit 3.0.0 on both ECS and EKS. On ECS, update the FireLens log-router container image in your task definition to the 3.0.0 tag from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. On EKS, upgrade by either updating the Helm release or setting the DaemonSet image to the 3.0.0 version.\n  The AWS for Fluent Bit image is available in the Amazon ECR Public Gallery and in the Amazon ECR repository. You can also find it on GitHub for source code and additional guidance.",
