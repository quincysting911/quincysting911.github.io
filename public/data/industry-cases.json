      "title": "AWS Security Agent (Preview): AI agent for proactive app security",
      "description": "Today, AWS announces the preview of AWS Security Agent, an AI-powered agent that proactively secures your applications throughout the development lifecycle. AWS Security Agent conducts automated security reviews tailored to your organizational requirements and delivers context-aware penetration testing. By continuously validating security from design to deployment, it helps prevent vulnerabilities early in development across all your environments.\n \nSecurity teams define organizational security requirements once in the AWS Security Agent console, such as approved encryption libraries, authentication frameworks, and logging standards. AWS Security Agent then automatically validates these requirements throughout development by evaluating architectural documents and code against your defined standards, providing specific guidance when violations are detected. For deployment validation, security teams define their penetration testing scope and AWS Security Agent develops application context, executes sophisticated attack chains, and discovers and validates vulnerabilities. This delivers consistent security policy enforcement across all teams, scales security reviews to match development velocity, and transforms penetration testing from a periodic bottleneck into an on-demand capability that dramatically reduces risk exposure.\n \nAWS Security Agent (Preview) is currently available in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. All of your data remains safe and private. Your queries and data are never used to train models. AWS Security Agent logs API activity to AWS CloudTrail for auditing and compliance.\n \nTo learn more about AWS Security Agent, visit the product page and read the launch announcement. For technical details and to get started, see the AWS Security Agent documentation.",

      "description": "Amazon Connect now allows you to test and simulate contact center experiences in just a few clicks, making it easy to validate workflows, self-service voice interactions, and their outcomes. For each test, you can configure the test parameters including the caller's phone number or customer profile, the reason for the call (such as \"I need to check my order status\"), the expected responses (such as \"Your request has been processed\"), and business conditions like after-hours scenarios or full call queues. After executing tests, results show success or failure based on your defined criteria, along with the path taken by the simulated interaction and detailed logs to quickly diagnose potential issues\n  With this launch, you can run multiple tests simultaneously to validate scenarios and workflows at scale, reducing testing time. Companies can view test results and identify common failure patterns across all their tests in Connect's analytics dashboards. These capabilities enable you to rapidly validate changes to your workflows and confidently deploy new experiences to adapt to your ever-changing business needs.\n  To learn more about these features, see the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. These features are available in all AWS regions where Amazon Connect is available. To learn more about Amazon Connect, AWS’s AI-native customer experience solution, please visit the Amazon Connect website.",

      "title": "Introducing Amazon Route 53 Global Resolver for secure anycast DNS resolution (preview)",
      "description": "Today, AWS announced the preview of Amazon Route 53 Global Resolver, a new internet-reachable DNS resolver that provides easy, secure, and reliable DNS resolution from anywhere for queries made by your authorized clients.\n  With Global Resolver, authorized clients in your organization can achieve split DNS resolution by resolving public domains on the internet and private domains associated with Route 53 private hosted zones, from anywhere. Global Resolver also allows you to create rules that protects your clients from DNS-based data exfiltration attacks. Using DNS Firewall rules for Global Resolver, you can filter queries for domains based on threat categories (e.g. Malware, Spam), web-content (e.g. Adult and Mature Content, Gambling), or advanced DNS threats (DNS tunneling, Domain Generation Algorithms), and log all queries centrally for easy auditing. Global Resolver enables you to achieve high availability of DNS resolution for your clients, by allowing you to select two or more regions for anycast DNS resolution with automatic failover to the closest available region.\n  With the launch of Global Resolver, we are renaming Route 53 Resolver to Route 53 VPC Resolver, to help clarify the distinction between the two services. Route 53 VPC Resolver allows you to resolve DNS queries from AWS resources in your Amazon VPCs for public domain names, VPC-specific DNS names, and Amazon Route 53 private hosted zones, and is available by default in each VPC. You can also associate Resolver endpoints with the VPC Resolver to forward DNS queries between your on-premises and Amazon VPCs.\n  Visit the service page for Global Resolver pricing and feature details. During the preview, Global Resolver will be available at no additional cost. For more information about AWS Regions where Global Resolver is available during preview, see here. To get started with a step-by-step walkthrough, see the AWS News Blog or documentation.",
